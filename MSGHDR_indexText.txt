14000\* TEMPLE *
14001\The complexities of life do distract and disorient, and thee shall
14002\know the turmoil of fear and uncertainty...
14003\He that hath not foundation shall in wandering suffer...
14004\While he that hath sanctuary shall know peace and stability...
14005\Discover thee the builder, that thee may light these eyes...
14006\For rooted in he lies the knowledge of structure...
14007\From encircling waters wrest thee the works of stones...
14008\As thee make sacrifice twixt all the four corners, thy labor
14009\shall not be in vain, for the opaque yielded from the stone
14010\will be transformed, and thee shall behold the radiant light...
14011\Thus may one discover a haven, and assuredly travel onward...
14012\Thus may one discover thyself, and assuredly travel through life...
14050\* BOAT *
14051\The waters of life do move as the weather, and in life as the
14052\waters, thee shall know both calm and storm...
14053\He that must embrace the storm shall soon be swept away...
14054\While he that learns to navigate, shall make his own journey...
14055\When thy fear has turned to anger, thee has lost thy soul,
14056\and shall make the devil laugh...
14057\But to still thy tongue and become amazed, thee begets enlightenment,
14058\and thus shall thee know bliss...
14059\Thus may one discover a craft, and sail upon the waters...
14060\Thus may one discover thyself, and sail upon life...
14100\* SERPENT *
14101\As the serpent winds and coils, so shall thy journey through life...
14102\He that comprehends the serpent shall ascend its mighty towers...
14103\While he that sets forth unknowing shall but sail endlessly
14104\within clouds of confusion and without enlightenment...
14105\Thus may one engage the mists of darkness and glimpse the light,
14106\and recognize the harbour of his twining purpose...
14107\Thus may one engage the mists of life and glimpse the light,
14108\and recognize the course of his twining destiny...
14150\* DRAGON *
14151\Inside a dragon's lair doth Man wander, in pursuit of his
14152\fulfillment, a monster behind every shadow lurking...
14153\His inner dreams doth hunger for noble rewards, while his world
14154\doth comprise naught but fruitless conflict and frustration...
14155\Only he that yet looks again at all he hath discovered, may
14156\find hidden the new meanings which lie concealed between the cracks
14157\of his brittle knowledge...
14158\Thus may one brave the shadowy dragons, and discover the hidden
14159\treasures of the labyrinth...
14160\Thus may one brave his shadowy fears, and discover the hidden
14161\treasures of life...
14200\* SPHINX *
14201\!And a vat of slugs shall be her womb, for amongst the hideous and
14202\foul doth the seed of her spirit lie waiting...
14203\From a bed of salt upon the pool of churning waters shall come the
14204\immaculate rebirth, and deliverance from the Sea of Chaos...
14205\So likened too is the life of man, born into a sea of strange
14206\voices, living in the land of salt, forever searching for the
14207\secret silent whisper that will ignite him, that he
14208\may open his eyes and stand free against the sky...
14209\Thus may one discover a bridge,
14210\and ascend from the bubbling turmoil...
14211\Thus may one discover thyself, and ascend from the chaos of life...
14250\* CRYPT *
14251\In the land of the Dead shall thee travel, an isle of ghosts and
14252\demons...
14253\For as thy knowledge be rooted in history past, thy thoughts shall
14254\be but echoes from the crypts of the lost and the dead...
14255\They that stare blindly into the hall of the past shall see not...
14256\While he that stands aloof and notes carefully, shall find the
14257\secrets which lie nestled along its outskirting waters...
14258\To embrace the dead as if truth, is to dwell in darkened crypts...
14259\To cast thine eyes upon the radiant sun, let this be thy truth...
14260\Thus may one escape the crypt, and depart the island cube...
14261\Thus may one escape the past, and depart the island mind...
14300\* LEGEND *
14301\Whatever was written upon the map has long ago faded...
14302\Now it is but a blank piece of parchment, dotted with several
14303\scattered holes...
14304\Around the edge of one hole near the center, you can just barely
14305\discern the faint remnants of a ring of reddish dye...
14350\* CRYSTAL *
14351\The Mind of Man doth speak a tongue all its own, beyond
14352\all language and all words...
14353\So too, doth the mind live in meanings and symbols, comprised of
14354\transient glimpses which signify its ephemeral understanding...
14355\As likened unto the crystal orbs of old mystics, piercing the veils
14356\of the unknown as a channel for hidden knowledge, likewise the mind
14357\makes crystal its symbols, that from this may be wrested forth
14358\the perceptions of the man...
14359\The Dragon for "D", the first of a word, and Obelisk for "O", that
14360\which should follow...
14361\The Moon stands for "M", and Island for "I", which is marked by the
14362\sign of the Cross...
14363\The Nether and Night, the realms of the dark, reveal the letter of
14364\"N" behind Death...
14365\And as the Star signs for Astral, let this be the "A", and lastly the
14366\Egg which is "E"...
14367\Thus may thee glimpse one meaning of the crystal, which lies branched
14368\among many thousands of combinations...
14369\Thus may thee glimpse one meaning of life, which lies branched
14370\among many thousands of dimensions...
14400\* STAR *
14401\As thy gaze doth turn to the heavens to behold the mystery of
14402\the stars, thee looks into the mirror of thy soul...
14403\Dost thou see the deep well of all things...
14404\Or only the swirling chaos of anarchy in motion...
14405\Therein doth the memories of past meet the visions of future, and
14406\therein lies the inevitable destiny of all Men...
14407\To divine the order from the chaos, the beauty within
14408\the cascading tumult of the world in which he is both
14409\surrounded and a part...
14410\This is the unique gift of Man, that by which he alone is
14411\separated from all others...
14412\This is his purpose, his significance, and his meaning...
14413\This is that by which he doth witness the relentless torrents
14414\of change, as all life doth move both within him and without,
14415\and from thus divine order, that he might realize his purpose and
14416\his meaning...
14417\Look upon life as thee may look upon the stone...
14418\And create thee then thine own order...
14419\Look first at a man, and if thee looks rightly, then soon shall
14420\ye come full circle...
14421\Then look beneath him, and if thee looks rightly, then soon shall
14422\thee once again come full circle...
14423\Thus may thee divine the puzzle from the pieces, and from it derive
14424\thy solutions...
14425\Thus may thee divine the order from the chaos, and from it derive
14426\thy meanings...
14450\* GLOBE *
14451\And one journey leads yet into another, so too doth all life
14452\continue onward...
14453\Within one seed doth lie the secrets of the universe, within
14454\one cell the secrets of life, and within thee the secrets of
14455\thy mystery...
14456\Thou art the key!
14500\- FOOLS -
14501\The map is a sketch of a vast wilderness, and drawn within it a
14502\trail which ends with an "X"...
15000\A gentle wind blows quietly through the trees,
15001\and for the first time in many months you feel alive...
15002\At long last free from the stuffy confines of the
15003\strange flying machine that brought you here, it is good
15004\to breathe deep these primal airs...
15005\An odd tingling sensation begins to stir inside you,
15006\unfamiliar at first, but then you remember...
15007\And with memory comes an exciting recognition, as if
15008\suddenly finding a thing thought lost long ago...
15009\For within the air you once again detect the
15010\unmistakable scent of danger...
15020\Walking through the trees, you suddenly stop...
15021\A torrent of thought sweeps past you, dark haunted
15022\images, escaping from behind the
15023\locked confines of your own mentations...
15024\Like a shock, your mind begins to race with the impact
15025\of all events that have brought you to this place...
15026\Does Mankind have a destiny?
15027\Does the Universe have a destiny?
15028\Could it be possible to alter the Universe of all that
15029\has been before?
15030\Or is all that can be, to remain all that is...
15031\Who is this Dark Savant, this dark herald of change?
15032\And what role shall you play?
15033\Will your actions assist the approach of a new
15034\order within the universe, or hasten the onslaught of
15035\its own destruction...
15036\And how can you be certain of the difference...
15037\These thoughts begin to fade as quickly as they
15038\appeared, and soon your gaze returns to the forest
15039\where you stand...
15040\Perhaps somewhere here on this new world lie the answers...
15041\And then again, perhaps not...
15060\You slowly awaken upon the ground, knowing not
15061\how you got here...
15062\The last thing you remember was walking amongst the
15063\pretty flowers and your eyes began to feel drowsy...
15070\Before you lies a vast field of wild orchids, rich in
15071\color, strong in fragrant aroma...
15072\A light cloud hovers a few feet above the field,
15073\as if made of thick pollen arising from the flowers...
15075\Standing amidst the pungent polleny poppy field, you stare agape at a
15076\large grey object which suddenly swooshes through the sky above you...
15077\You know what it is, and yet it cannot be...
15078\There, far away and high above, went a great grey flying whale...
15080\There is a cold dullness to the town of New City...
15081\As you pause and listen to the howl of the wind, whistling
15082\through the alleyways of the city, you can almost
15083\hear faint whispers from behind
15084\the drawn shuttered windows...
15085\And the clatter of footsteps underneath the
15086\rustle of scattering leaves...
15087\As if some dark cloud had descended upon the place, choking
15088\from it the sparkle of life that perhaps it once possessed...

15105\The towering trees loom heavy and dark, and the forest dons
15106\a creepy shroud as if to whisper, Beware!
15110\A soft crunching noise can be heard nearby, like the kind
15111\of sound that might come from an animal chewing branches...
15112\Or bones...
15120\An old corroded chest is lying underneath the trees...
15121\How strange to be so abandoned, and you wonder if perhaps its
15122\owner fell victim to the appetites of the local fauna...
15125\Inside the aged chest you find a bundle of items, along with
15126\a sack of gold coins...
15130\The sea spans outward from the small lagoon, calm and peaceful...
15131\A small white dome, half-buried, juts peculiarly from the
15132\ground at the water's edge...
15135\Excavating the odd relic, you discover it isn't a dome at all...
15136\It is the fractured remnant of a human skull...
15137\Somehow, the waters don't seem quite as alluring as they did a
15138\few moments ago...

16030*\=901,The history of Old City! 
16031\That's what I've been researching... 
16032\Listen, and I'll tell you what I've learned... 
16033\A long time ago, everyone lived together here... 
16034\All in the same city... Old City... 
16035\Life was simple for our ancestors, there was a common purpose... 
16036\To fulfill the law of something called the Sacred Stone! 
16037\But as time went on, there was disagreement upon the meaning
16038\of the sacred writing... 
16039\Everyone began having different ideas... 
16040\And they began to fight amongst themselves... 
16041\Different groups were formed, each claiming to represent the
16042\one true interpretation of the Sacred Stone... 
16043\In time, each faction created their own version of the
16044\Sacred Stone, rewriting it to conform to their own beliefs... 
16045\The original Sacred Stone was lost, obscured, and forgotten... 
16046\Eventually, all anyone knew was dependent upon the beliefs of
16047\the faction unto which they were born... 
16048\Naturally, the different factions began to separate... 
16049\Soon, newer cities were constructed in the surrounding regions... 
16050\And Old City was abandoned... 
16051\All evidence of our original common ancestry disappeared... 
16052\There were wars... 
16053\The simple life had come to an end... 
16054\And each faction began to evolve in an entirely different way... 
16055\Some believed that this was bad... 
16056\Others claim that it was all foretold... 
16057\And a few others yet say that this is all as it should be... 
16058\Hundreds of years passed... 
16059\Then, one day, a strange thing occurred... 
16060\A group of strangers appeared, calling themselves the Higardi... 
16061\They said they came from the mountains, where they had
16062\been living in the ages since the fall of Old City... 
16063\They had achieved great scientific wonders... 
16064\And they wished to share their knowledge with all... 
16065\A common ground was needed for all the differing factions to
16066\meet with the Higardi, and so New City was constructed... 
16067\And it was built on top of Old City... 
16068\Then, as suddenly as they had appeared, the Higardi vanished! 
16069\No one knows exactly what happened... 
16070\There must have been some purpose... 
16071\But no one knows what it is! 
16072\And so then, at last, here we are...
16080*\Mmmm, let me think a moment... 
16081\There were some archives in the Old City... 
16082\When New City was built the archives were sealed off
16083\and covered over... 
16084\Years ago, I went there to study records of our history... 
16085\I think I may still have the key, one moment... 
16086\I hope this helps with what you are looking for...
16090*\The access to the Old City is on the south side of New City... 
16091\It's been locked up for years...

16121\!LIBRARY
16122\@A vivid red emblem has been attached to the door, the
16123\significance of which is not clear...
16130*\Cautiously you look around, wary of the foreboding
16131\emblem which marked the front of the library door...
16132\@The interior of the library is quite dusty and cluttered,
16133\being filled with shelves of books and old scrolls...
16134\@It would require days to search through them all, and even
16135\then it is unlikely that anything here would be of much use...
16136\@For some reason you turn and cast a glance sideways,
16137\toward the north end of the room, and there, perched slightly
16138\apart from the volumes around it, you spy a dark red book...
16139\@But suddenly you are startled by the gaunt figure of one
16140\of the ghoulish Savant Guards, unearthly still, uncannily poised
16141\in the corner beside the shelf on which the book rests...
16142\@Ready to jump into action, yet still frozen where you stand,
16143\before you can react your senses tell you there is something
16144\peculiar about the situation...
16145\@Within the heartbeat of the next moment, you can see that
16146\the dreaded Guardian is not reacting, nor making motions
16147\of any kind...
16148\@Whether it is entranced, or dead, or asleep you cannot tell...
16149\@Perhaps there is some secret power or weakness to which it has

16235*\You detect no trace of footprints in the moldy floor, nor
16236\any other evidence to indicate the presence of others...
16240*\You are able to detect faint footprints in the moldy floor,
16241\suggesting that someone else has been here recently...
16245*\The room appears vacant, though the air is quite ripe with
16246\the putrid stench of something dead...
16250*\A horrid waft of stinking air assails you!
16260*\Inside the chest, neatly swaddled in a waxy wrapping, you
16261\uncover an old piece of enscribed parchment...

16301\and it is a welcome change from the otherwise gloomy city...
16302\@There is an arched gazebo in the center of the courtyard

16305*\Standing at the statue, it appears much larger than before...
16306\@The stone looks fresh, as if it were carved only yesterday,
16307\although a thick layer of rust around its base suggests
16308\it has been here a long time...
16309\@Gazing up into the face of the majestic figure, you detect
16310\a faint smile and its eyes seem to almost twinkle...
16315*\=943,Scraping off the thick rust, you unearth a metal plate at

16323\@It indeed swings open, pivoting at the top, and underneath
16324\you find a small opaque stone, apparently concealed here a long
16325\time ago...
16380*\The great Sea of Sorrows spans before you like a vast
16381\and dense space flattened unto the sky, spreading into the
16382\far distant horizon as a desolate plain of shimmering ether...
16383\@Its deep waters chant a thousand silent tales, and its unseen
16384\borders but hint of far distant lands...
16385\@How universal such a compelling motion, as if behind every veil
16386\of boundless unknown lay cloaked an invisible beacon, endlessly
16387\calling...
16388\@Such solace these sights bring, as if a reminder that though
16389\the trappings of mortal man be forever enshrouded in a
16390\sea of passing discords, he has but to open his eyes that he
16391\may bear witness to some greater existance of which he is only a

16413\in the block he is carving that he fails to take notice of you...
16414\@Looking back at the trophies in detail, any thoughts of taking

16416\of being ripped to shreds...
16417\@The old munk giggles, looks up, and then goes back to work...
16418\@On the far wall you notice an empty trophy plaque, though it
16419\is too far to read from here...

16462\Aye, there's many a danger out there on that sea, that's why
16463\it's called the Sea of Sorrows...
16470*\There's a tale that in early times ships traveled freely across

16500*\A lonely plaque devoid of trophy hangs from the wall...
16501\@It reads: BROMBADEG
16510*\Spanning the room, suspended by hoists and beams, the skeleton
16511\of a small sailing vessel awaits completion...
16512\@Looking closely at the unfinished ship, discoloration in
16513\the wood of various sections suggest the small boat has
16514\probably been under construction for several years, possibly
16515\more...
16516\@It is evident that at this rate of progress, it could be
16517\a decade before the ship is ready to sail the open seas...
16518\@Clearly, there is little hope of it being of any use in your

16535*\Inside the window, a grimey gooey brown substance slowly
16536\drips along the walls...
16540*\The room invokes a rather queasy sense of dread, as deposits
16541\of an icky brown substance covering the walls and floor suggests
16542\the thought of some kind of weird alien habitat...
16545*\In the corner of the room you spy a huge foaming brown mass
16546\as it begins to move in your direction...
16550*\Afloat within the shallows of the water is a peculiar looking
16551\vessel, a boat, but unlike any other that you have ever seen...
16555*\Stepping aboard the strange craft, you see that while it appears
16556\to be made of wood and steel, further investigation reveals
16557\it is actually built of an unknown hard glossy material...
16558\@Tough, resilient, and obviously waterproof...
16559\@It makes you wonder about the origin of the boat, and how long it
16560\has been harbored here...
16561\@The most interesting feature of the craft, however, is the tall
16562\oven like barrel which sits at the rear of the ship, the purpose
16563\of which is not clear...
16564\@It then strikes you that there is no visible means for propelling
16565\the small skiff...
16566\@Only the rudder pole, a banking oar, and a stange handle attached
16567\to the side of the barrel...
16570*\Gracing the bow of the ship is the carved head of a fierce looking,
16571\long nosed, bandit eyed, furry faced mongrel...
16572\@Mounted behind the wolflike figurehead is a plate which reads:
16573\@#!WIKUM !BOAT
16574\@You ponder over what a "WIKUM" might be...
16575\@Investigating the barrel in more detail, you note its odd features...
16576\@Inside it are number of long round tubes, which arise
16577\from underneath one side of the large canister, loop around a
16578\black metal tripod at its center, and then descend back into
16579\the bottom of the barrel on the other side...
16580\@Banging on the tubes, you detect that they are hollow...
16581\@However, you still can find no means of making the vessel move...
16590*\Placing the black globe onto the tripod in the center of the
16591\odd canister barrel, you gasp as it starts to glow...
16592\@After a few moments, you can hear water rushing up through the
16593\tubes inside the barrel, and soon see a rush of water emerging
16594\out the rear of the craft...
16595\@Grabbing the rudder and pulling the handle on the side of the

16634\@While there does not appear to be any particular meaning to
16635\the abstract background of the relief, you discover that the
16636\small burlesque heads can be twisted around...
16637\@You are surprised to learn that when a head is oriented in one
16638\direction it appears to convey a certain emotion, and by
16639\turning it upside down, the original face reverses
16640\and then extols an opposite expression...
16641\@You wonder if perhaps there is some meaning in this madness...

16671\up and down, making an odd twanging kind of sound...

16712\@Hovering above a marble pedestal are four glowing balls...
16713\@The balls are aligned in the form of a pyramid, three at the
16714\base in the shape of a triangle, and the fourth on top as the
16715\peak...
16716\@The balls do not appear to be connected to the pedestal in
16717\any way, and you cannot readily explain how it is that they
16718\remain suspended above it...
16719\@Of even more interest however, is that within the pyramid
16720\floats an ornate and dazzling wand, which bathes the area
16721\with a radiant aura...

16755*\Feeling around inside the invisible vat of slugs, your fingers

16824\fills your head with images of a crime most foul...
16825\@There is no clue as to the identity of the remains, but gauging
16826\from the soggy squish of its moldered flesh, you can guess it has
16827\been here for at least several months...

16840*\The vault room appears to be empty, save for a slight gleam in

17105*\From above, heavy gusts of fresh air rush past you, winding
17106\into the deep recesses of the Castle...
17107\@Would that you could ride this wind, to make your journey
17108\short and to the point...
17109\@As it is, now you must stand against the very fortress itself...
17110\@The stones of Orkogre Castle are old, centuries old, and it makes
17111\you wonder about the history of this place and its people...
17112\@You think of how little you really know about them, and
17113\that it is you who are the alien intruders...
17120*\Upon the old scroll you read this hastily scrawled message:

17225*\The air is somewhat stale, suggesting the chamber hasn't been

17228*\You discover a faint trail of bloody tracks which cross the room...
17230*\The room is dry and stolid, its only feature being a single

17297\@Now, only the lone figure silhouetted upon the distant throne,

17871\long supple tube, itself connected to a bulbous vase upon
17872\which rests a bowl of burning embers, a sedate munk succulently

18502\@The sign appears to be out of date, for it is quite plain that
18503\there is no bridge which crosses the river here...
18504\@There is, however, a long steel cable which has been drawn taut
18505\between two trees on each side of the river, and perhaps
18506\there is a way to make use of it in some fashion...
18510*\From somewhere nearby on the riverbank you hear the slurred sounds
18511\of someone singing, or at least trying to...
18512\@After a moment you decide that it's not singing, it's... 
18513\it's,... it's crooning, badly out of tune,
18514\and you are sure the mysterious minstrel is
18515\either completely deaf, trying to scare some animal, or is dying
18516\in great pain...
18517\@Finally, you spot the wailing figure rising up from the bank,
18518\and after brushing the leaves and dirt from his robes, he turns
18519\in your direction, mercifully desisting in his aria from hell
18520\as he stumbles up to meet you...
18530*\Welcome brothers! 
18531\I am Brother TShober, guardian of Munkharama Bridge... 
18532\That is, I was when there was a bridge here, only now I still
18533\am but there isn't one... I mean... O nevermind...

18537\How may I help you, good brothers?
18540*\NO/YES/
18541\
18542\Are you traveling to the Holy City of Munkharama?
18545*\Well then, I suppose it's none of my business...
18550*\Good fortune you have found me then, for the iniquitous Munks of
18551\the Dark Forest have been afoot, spreading their foul and
18552\sinful ways and 'tis not a safe place to venture these days... 
18553\They come from the underworld, and though the holy path teaches
18554\us to be kindly to our brethren, I say cut off their faces... 
18555\Er,... I mean, I think they are in need of a few good reminders
18556\of the virtues of the rightful path, if you know what I mean... 
18557\Usually they keep to the forests, or make the journey to New City
18558\to work their profanities, but that has changed and now
18559\they have infested the Holy City with their filthy ways... 
18560\Methinks they have even been plotting unholy sacrilege
18561\with the blaspheming scum born of Dane! 
18562\Um,... er, that is, those unfortunate brethren of the Dane who
18563\are confused and have strayed far, yes, far, o yes very far indeed,
18564\from the blessed path of the true and rightful way...
18570*\YES/-NO/
18571\
18572\Be you wanting to cross the river?
18575*\Good!
18577*\Thy purse is lacking!
18580*\NO/YES/
18581\
18582\Um, that is then, you wish to pay the 150 GP fee, er, donation?
18585*\Hrrumph! 
18586\May thee be'est prickled by the sharp point of the path!
18650*\You watch as Brother TShober climbs up into a tree, attaching an
18651\odd looking wheel and handle to the cable which spans the river...
18652\@After giving it a convincing tug, he motions for you to approach
18653\and grab hold of the handle...
18654\@Once everyone is prepared, he begins turning the crank...
18670*\Be thankful ye that hath an ear! 
18671\You are learning the way of the holy path! 
18672\I was sure of it the moment I saw you!
18675*\
NO/YES/
18676\
18677\Are you willing to face danger to continue thy holy journey?
18680*\Very well then, brothers...
18685*\=936,=968,You must find a way into the Hidden Temple of Munkharama, which
18686\lies underneath the Holy City... 
18687\The Temple was built at the beginning of time, when the
18688\heavens were created, to protect and keep safe the holy work... 
18689\But the infernal brethren, may holy lightning burn them all forever,
18690\from the Dark Forest, have made it an underworld of stench and decay,
18691\a fortress to hide and harbour their impious lot... 
18692\They seek to discover the secret of the holy work! 
18693\But only those of the true path know the way... 
18694\Deep within the Temple, underground waters from the river flow
18695\freely, and keep it flooded... 
18696\But we rightful brethren know that beyond those waters lies
18697\safe the holy work... 
18698\You must brave the unholy Munks, may blessed rotworms forever fester
18699\in their malaised bowels, of the Dark Forest, and find where the
18700\waters flood... 
18701\There, aside the Golden Face, search ye for the true path! 
18702\Once you have safely secured the holy work, take it to
18703\Master Xheng, Lord of the 5 Flowers... 
18704\He will know the holy word: &
18705\Slay not he that cannot hear, 
18706\Be thankful ye that hath an ear! 
18707\Recant this to him, or finish what he begins,
18708\and he will know thee as disciples of the holy path... 
18709\And good brethren, you shall also have need of this!
18720*\Hoyo...
18725*\Bodendoi...
18750*\Attaching the Munk's trolly to the cable, you crank yourself across
18751\the river...
18810*\You stand in a pleasant courtyard, the air smells fresh, and
18811\the playful sounds of practicing munks sings in the breeze as
18812\they move and frolic in the open grass...
18813\@Soon, one of the young munks sees you, and gives a slight cry
18814\pointing in your direction...
18815\@All of the other munks stop and turn to look, and after brief
18816\pause, wildly scramble into the ancient dojo behind them...
18820*\#!Xen Xheng
18821\!School of 5 Flowers
18830*\Entering the dojo, you look upon the wide eyed faces of the
18831\eager munk students, who seem quite curious about
18832\your appearance...
18833\@You hear a loud hand clap...
18834\@In the blink of an eye or two, the young disciples make their best
18835\attempt at disappearing into the nooks and crevices of the house,
18836\and with the exception of an errant foot or portion of a robe
18837\sticking out here and there, and for the few occasional giggles,
18838\you could almost be fooled into thinking there was some small chance
18839\the dojo might be empty...
18840\@But to make up for the obvious deficiencies in the obfuscationary
18841\efforts of the students, the master of the house appears
18842\so suddenly at your face that you decide to believe he came out of
18843\thin air rather than to consider the possibility that anyone
18844\could really move that fast...
18850*\=968,BE THANKFL/=968,YE THAT HA/=968,TH AN EAR/-EXCUSE ME?/
18851\
18852\Slay not he that cannot hear!
18855*\I see you are learning well the virtuous ways of the holy path... 
18856\I have been expecting you!
18860*\NO/YES/-DON'T HAVE/
18861\
18862\Have you obtained the holy work?
18865*\Careful, least thy failure become a habit! 
18866\Go now, find the holy work and do not return until thy task is done!
18870*\NO/YES/
18871\
18872\Ah, very good then, may I have it?
18875*\Then you shall receive in accordance with what you have given!
18880*\Good, good! You have done well! 
18881\You must now decide whether to pursue your own course, or
18882\whether you wish to continue your journey along the holy path
18883\and learn the ways of the 5 Flowers... 
18884\If your destiny bids you elsewhere, then you will remain as
18885\faithful brothers, and I shall help you in your endeavors... 
18886\Should you choose the path of the 5 Flowers, then shall I do my part
18887\to teach you, but you must be prepared to make sacrifice...
18895*\NO/YES/
18896\
18897\Do you wish to learn the ways of the 5 Flowers?
18900*\=970,Thy destiny then is thy own... 
18901\Seek out Father Rulae in the Abbey of New City... 
18902\Tell him that you have learned the Holy Sacrament, and he shall
18903\aid you in your journey...
18905*\Welcome brothers...
18906\May fortune grant thee thy desevres...
18910*\=970,Seek out Father Rulae in the Abbey of New City...
18911\@Tell him that you have learned the Holy Sacrament, and he shall
18912\aid you in your journey...
18913\@P.S. Have you discovered yet the secret of the 5 Flowers?
18914\@Mix the Red Rosis and the Blue Mythia, the Yellow Lione and the Purple
18915\Plumac, then these together, and lastly a divine (albeit odorous)
18916\solution of White Dahlia...
18917\@May the fortunes smile upon you!
18920*\=938,Then so be it... 
18921\The School of 5 Flowers accepts you as initiates... 
18922\In the Mountains of Ukpyr seek the Rosis, the Plumac, the Lione,
18923\the Mythia, and the heavenly Dahlia... 
18924\Once you have gathered them, return and find me here... 
18925\There is also a trove of special regalia in the back room, which
18926\you are now entitled to wear... 
18927\You may take anything you find useful...
18930*\We wish you well good brothers, but only they that follow the
18931\holy path may enter herein...
18940*\The dojo is empty...
18941\@Really empty this time, with no trace of the young munks or the
18942\Master Xheng to be found...
18945*\At your feet, a small sealed parchment lies neatly placed
18946\upon the floor...
19000*\#!Entering
19001\!NYCTALINTH
19010*\As you step into the entrance of the town, you are met by one
19011\of the fetid T'Rang, mouth adrip with foamy bile, excreting
19012\a trail of brown mucus behind him...
19013\@In a strange mixture of clicks and hisses he utters sounds that
19014\are almost word like...
19020*\=921,Ssssst The Watchers told us you were coming... 
19021\Enter, but be wary... 
19022\We do not like your kind! 
19023\You must proceed to the High Chamber... 
19024\Where H'Jenn-Ra T'Rang awaits... 
19025\Do not attempt to deceive us!
19030*\The town of Nyctalinth lies in a decaying state of ruin, it's former
19031\majesty here in the northlands reduced to ragged weeds and crumbling
19032\stones...
19033\@You glance an occasional group of T'Rang in the distance, always
19034\quick of pace as they scurry from one building to another, hobbling
19035\sideways in their crab like fashion upon a quartet of crusty limbs...
19036\@Their heads jerk oddly, to and fro in an agitated manner as if
19037\they were extremely uncomfortable about something or else disturbed
19038\by having to venture outdoors exposed in the open...
19039\@And always behind them follows a trail of slimey brown goo...
19040\@It appears that they have indeed adopted Nyctalinth as their
19041\temporary home on this unusual world, and once again glancing about
19042\the dilapidated ruins, it seems a quite fitting and appropriate
19043\choice...
19050*\#!LIVESTOCK
19051\!Breeding Ground
19055*\Stepping into the area, you know immediately that this building
19056\was not intended as a habitat for holding animals, as traces of
19057\faded and cracking paint covering the walls suggest some kind of
19058\artistic decoration that is not customary for slaughterhouses...
19059\@Apparently the T'Rang have little appreciation for such things,
19060\if indeed they have any capacity at all to even recognize the
19061\concept of such things as beauty or art...
19062\@For them, a building is a place to put things, nothing more...
19063\@As for this former church, once created to offer amelioration,
19064\now it is a battlefield of bloody stains, prison, and inevitable
19065\abattoir...
19070*\Stepping into the small cathedral, you are attacked by swarms of
19071\jittery bugs...
19075*\It now occurs to you that some T'Rang is probably going to have to
19076\explain to his superiors how the food supply suddenly died...
19077\@They are probably not going to be too pleased about it either...
19080*\The small alcove is empty, tough a faint image is still visible
19081\upon the wall in front of you...
19082\@It depicts a group of rather short squattish men kneeling before
19083\a bright radiance in the sky, in which a giant figure seems to
19084\be handing them some kind of sacred scroll...
19090*\From out of the wall a strangely familiar apparition appears...
19092*\Follow me!
19094*\Stepping through the wall, you are not sure whether it was the stone
19095\that momentarily turned evanescent or whether it was yourselves...
19096\@However, the slight tingling sensation that you felt as you passed
19097\through has now receded and the walls are once again quite solid
19098\to the touch...
19100*\Inside the small crypt, upon an altar of stone, rests an ornate
19101\staff sequined with a glimmering jewel... 
19102\Suddenly you hear a screaming cry!
19105*\Charging through the wall at a rampage, a mad laughing ghost
19106\bellows a ghastly cackle as he grabs the jeweled rod on the altar,
19107\disappearing out the other side...
19110*\You rub the small figurine as if you knew what to expect...
19111\@After a brief moment, you are startled by footsteps and the sound
19112\of faint voices coming from the other twin crypt... 
19113\Suddenly you hear a screaming cry bellow from the other crypt!
19120*\Through the wall charges the gloating ghost at full gallop,
19121\brandishing the enchanted staff with mad delight! 
19122\He stops and gasps, obviously in great shock and amazement at your
19123\presence here! 
19124\His eyes twist around in his head as he looks at you and then
19125\back through the wall in the direction of the other crypt, and
19126\then back at you and he tries to scream but no sound emerges... 
19127\Finally, out comes the frustrated howl, as dropping the staff he
19128\grabs the small idol from your hands and blazes out the wall in a
19129\discombobulated and confused state of mind...
19135*\Spanning between the two pillars, an energy field pulsates with a
19136\low crackling hum...
19137\@Feeling a bit like warm steel, it serves as a barrier blocking
19138\any passage beyond it...
19145*\Clutching the jeweled staff obtained from the galloping ghost,
19146\you are able to pass through the barrier as if it were not there...
19150*\#!Tomb Of
19151\!VILET KANEBE
19155*\The sepulcher is old, dusty and filled with the webs of a thousand
19156\generations of spiders...
19157\@As you look into the dark tomb, you see it
19158\contains not a coffin, but an old encrusted chest...
19160*\Much to your dismay, however, telltale footprints in the dusty
19161\crypt betray a recent visitation by other guests...
19165*\And something in the shadows!
19170*\Inside the chest, wrapped and well preserved, you extract an
19171\old piece of parchment, enscribed with numerous writings, marks, and
19172\legends...
19175*\Alas, the chest is filled with naught but glittering dust...
19180*\#!T'Rang Empire
19181\!TACTICAL DEPOT
19190*\A large reinforced steel door has been installed to prevent
19191\any accidental intrusion by unauthorized personnel...
19192\@Mounted to the latch of the door is a thick metal block, in which
19193\a finger hole has been bored...
19205*\You push the transparent rod into the latch hole...
19210*\Inside the depot area stands a rack of unusual looking polestaffs...
19215*\Breaking into the depot area, you confront a group of T'Rangs busy
19216\at work with a small hand held object... 
19217\Without hesitation they attack!
19220*\Searching the room, you find a crude drawing depicting the object
19221\disassembled into many pieces, with strange words, marks, lines
19222\and arrows scribbled all over it...
19223\@Sketched into a corner of the parchment is a smaller assembled
19224\version of the device emitting some kind of ray, and a few
19225\crumpled bodies in its path...
19226\@It makes you wonder about the intelligence of these creatures to
19227\have to go to so much trouble just to make something that a
19228\broadsword could easily accomplish with a few good swipes...
19230*\#!T'Rang Empire
19231\!SECURITY
19235*\From a plaque mounted to the wall hangs several transparent
19236\cylinders, each about the size of a good finger...
19237\@Cautiously you take a sniff, but no odor...
19238\@Finally, you pluck one into your mouth, but being tasteless and
19239\not very pleasant, you can only suspect that they must have some
19240\other intended purpose and don't wish to think further upon where
19241\such a thing might be inserted...
19250*\#!T'Rang Empire
19251\!HIGH CHAMBER
19255*\Hssst You are the ones the Watchers have spoken of... 
19256\H'Jenn-Ra T'Rang is ready to receive you!
19260*\A large assemblage of T'Rangs stand guard in the corner of the
19261\room, carefully observing your every move...
19262\@One of them motions to the door, pointing three hands and a claw...
19263\@Clearly, he wants you to step through the door...
19265*\Sssst Not this way! 
19270*\#!IMPERIAL
19271\!CHAMBER
19275*\You are surrounded on both sides by
19276\dozens of the twitching T'Rangs, ready to strike should you make
19277\the slightest wrong move...
19278\@To the north lies a small window, and thirteen dozen paws, claws
19279\and appendages point the way...
19285*\Stepping up to the window, you peer into it...
19286\@Seeing nothing, you wait...
19287\@Very slowly, a large bulbous brown mass draws up to the other side
19288\of the bars, and amidst a spewel of drool and foam begins to
19289\speak in a deep roar of cackles and spit...
19300*\HSSSHHHTT! I AM H'JENN-RA T'RANG... 
19301\I DO NOT TRUST YOU... 
19302\BUT YOU MIGHT BE USEFUL TO THE T'RANG EMPIRE...

19304\I SHALL SEND YOU TO SHRITIS...

19310\THE ANTHRACAX SHALL DELIVER YOU TO HIM... 
19311\IF YOU SURVIVE! HAA HAA HAAASSHHHT!
19315*\The obese brown slug slowly slithers back from the window, leaving
19316\you to ponder his message...
19320*\The surrounding hordes of T'Rangs move to one side as you step
19321\forward, a symphony of crusty limbs pointing towards the door to
19322\the west...
19325*\#!T'Rang Empire
19326\!ANTHRACAX
19335*\Pulling the lever, a low pitched hum fills your ears, and a
19336\faint blue glow bathes the room...
19345*\And then the cobalt light disappears...
19350*\The T'Rang guardians look a bit perplexed to see you, but
19351\move aside to allow you access to the window behind which
19352\resides H'Jenn-Ra T'Rang...
19360*\I SEE YOU HAVE RETURNED SSSST!

19367\NOR THE SECOND BUT FIRST AFTER THE SIXTH 
19368\IT IS THE FIFTH THAT IS FIRST 
19369\AND THE FOURTH AFTER THIRD WHICH IS SECOND 
19370\AND ONLY THEN SHALL THE WAY BE REVEALED... 
19371\GO THERE AND FIND FOR ME THIS MAP OF THE BOAT! 
19372\DO NOT TRESPASS ELSEWHERE OR YOU SHALL BE DESTROYED! 
19373\AND REMEMBER... 
19374\THE WATCHERS SEE EVERYWHERE!
19380*\The garrison of T'Rangs seem unduly agitated, as if poised
19381\to strike...
19382\@Still, they part to allow you passage to the west door...
19385*\HSSST! DO NOT RETURN UNTIL YOU HAVE OBTAINED THE MAP OF THE BOAT!
19390*\HSSSS GOOD GOOD! 
19391\NOW PROVE YOURSELF TO H'JENN-RA T'RANG! 
19392\THERE ARE THOSE WHO SERVE THE DARK MENACE...

19397\AND THEN LEAVE THIS PLACE... 
19398\WE SHALL REWARD YOU WELL WHEN OUR VICTORY IS COMPLETE! 
19399\GO AND DO THIS FOR THE T'RANG EMPIRE... 
19400\GO AND DO NOT RETURN! 
19405*\Once again the T'Rang warriors stand aside to allow you to pass...
19406\@But only through the center door...
19410*\Inside the chamber, several T'Rangs are chopping chunks of a
19411\gutted giant bug into a sickening gruel, dumping the contents
19412\into a huge bowl...
19413\@The stench is almost overwhelming...
19414\@As you enter, they turn to meet the challenge...
19420*\In a sickening atmosphere of brown gooey mire, the great lumbering
19421\slug known as H'Jenn-Ra T'Rang slurps a stinking gruel from a giant
19422\bowl... 
19423\Even more revolting however, are the large round putrid balls which
19424\seem to be pouring out of his tremendous worm like abdomen, eggs
19425\to spawn thousands of his kind upon this small world... 
19426\Espying you as you enter his chamber, H'Jenn-Ra the giant Slug
19427\Queen unleashes a grievious wail and rises to
19428\devour your invasion party... 
19430*\NO/YES/

19446\snatches it from you...
19450*\#!T'Rang Guardia
19451\!LANDING PORT
19455*\Upon the surface of the flat stone pavement are spots of a thick
19456\black sooty residue, as if a barrage of blazing fireballs
19457\had fallen from the sky and pelted the area...
19460*\The room is moderately bare, though an unusual looking honeycomb
19461\sculpture inhabits the southwest corner...
19465*\Looking closer at the sculpture, it would more likely appear to
19466\be a desk of some sort, designed to conform to the various anomalies
19467\of the T'Rang anatomies...
19470*\Searching through the honeycombed facility, you discover a black
19471\book...
19475*\The markings in the book are unrecognizable...

19517\@That is the last entry in the book...
19520*\=921,In the most nauseating atmosphere imaginable, the carcass of the
19521\great lumbering slug known as H'Jenn-Ra T'Rang lies hacked to
19522\pieces upon the chamber floor...
19523\@Even more disgusting however, are the large round putrid balls which
19524\were pouring out of his tremendous worm like abdomen, eggs
19525\to spawn thousands of his kind upon this small world...
19526\@Apparently, someone else has little love of the T'Rang, for they
19527\have certainly insured that H'Jenn-Ra will never again pose any
19528\threat to anyone...
19530*\#!OBSERVATION
19531\!CONTROL CENTER
19532\@A vivid red emblem has been attached to the door, the
19533\significance of which is not clear...
19535*\The Control Center is filled with a vast complex of machines and
19536\blinking boxes...
19537\@Also present is a garrison of the Savant Guardians, some of which
19538\seem to be busy working at the equipment...
19539\@As you enter the room, one of them flees into an adjoining chamber,
19540\while the rest advance to engage...
19545*\Stepping up to one of the shimmering boxes you see glowing words
19546\which appear to be floating inside it...
19548*\Deactivation Sequence Initiated 
19549\Terminal Linkage Disconnect 
19550\SERVER: 023@41A2 
19551\HOST: Black Ship Command 
19552\Remote Access Terminated 
19553\Memory Purge Complete
19555*\=944,=945,That is all you can read before the face of the box turns black...
19557*\All of the machines have suddenly become quiet and blank...
19560*\You confront several more of the dread Savants, and behind them a
19561\Controller works quickly and efficiently at more of the mysterious
19562\machines...
19563\@As the guardians attack, the machines begin to grow dark, one by
19564\one...
19566*\Sensing the information might be of some importance, you hastily
19567\scribble it down on a piece of parchment...
19570*\The magic seems to have vanished from the puzzling boxes, and the
19571\various stations now lie vacant and dead...
19572\@As you slowly cast your gaze about the chamber, the wonderment
19573\of these creatures and their machines begins to gnaw at the back
19574\of your brain, and you remember your strange voyage here in the
19575\ship that flys through the air and amongst the stars...
19576\@It is a thing altogether different from your world and what you
19577\have known, for these entities seem to wield a power unknown to
19578\you,...
19579\@A power that seems to defy the laws of nature itself...
19580\@A power to weave abstract mathematical thought into a reality
19581\composed of new unfathomable dimensions, tempering the energy of
19582\the spheres as if it were but a weight of common steel...
19583\@And yet, for all their magiks, still do they walk and bleed and
19584\die as mere mortal men, and seem driven by the same hungers of
19585\conquest and domination that has ruled life since times primordial...
19586\@How very strange...
19590*\On top of one of the tablestations, you find a small
19591\enigmatic object, whose purpose you cannot imagine...
19592\@It is labeled: TX-Coder
19595*\Standing closer, the bones of the adventurers appear quite ancient...
19597*\Searching through the remains of the dead party, you find some
19598\very old and interesting items...
19600*\You land with a hard thud, tumbling along the ground...
19602*\Shaking the dizziness from your head, you stand up to
19603\find yourself in a large cavern...
19604\@The atmosphere seems breathable, though dry and a bit stale...
19605\@Peering up toward the surface, you spot the place from whence you
19606\fell about thirty feet above your head, a hole of light in
19607\the darkness of the cavern sky...
19610*\Stepping into the area, your foot suddenly plunges into a soft spot
19611\of the ground, releasing an ochre green gas...
19615*\!Gas Pocket!
19620*\=G12.0,In the cavern ahead of you are piles of large gooey balls, which
19621\fill the area completely...
19622\@The odor coming from the balls is quite obnoxious, and the goo
19623\that binds them together a sticky putrid molasses...
19625*\Trying to navigate the volume of strange sticky pones, you become
19626\hopelessly covered in their thick goo...
19630*\Finally you turn back, realizing there is no way to get through
19631\without becoming so immersed with the mirey balls that they would
19632\suck you in to linger a slow suffocating death...
19633\@It makes you think that perhaps this is a natural ability by which
19634\the odd balls obtain nourishment, presuming, of course, that they
19635\are alive in some fashion...
19640*\=S27.15, =F30,Pulling the small pin from the metal pineapple, you toss it into
19641\the cavern of sticky balls...
19645*\Ahead in the cavern lies a clutter of rags and bones, the remains
19646\of some ill fated band of travelers...
19647\@As you start to wonder whether anything of value might be
19648\found amongst the departed, a movement appears in the shadows...
19650*\A seering envelop of flames engulfs you!
19655*\In the cavern ahead of you are piles of black carbonized
19656\shells...
19660*\Passing through the area, the charred shells crumbled and flake
19661\with a soft crunch as you trod over them...
19665*\=G13.0, Everywhere around you are blackened empty husks...
19670*\Emerging from the cavern, you are relieved to find yourself once
19671\again in relatively safe surroundings...
19672\@But what is that awful smell...
19675*\Neatly situated, side by side as if statues in a garden, three
19676\Savant Guardians stand motionless, frozen in time...
19677\@There is no indication of wounds or damage, and yet they appear
19678\lifeless and quite dead...
19680*\You approach one of the immobile Savant Guardians...
19681\@It appears to be dead...
19685*\Pointing the hand held device at the frozen Guard, you pull
19686\the small tong on its underbelly, bathing the statue in a
19687\wide glowing ray... 
19688\Nothing seems to be happening... 
19689\When suddenly sparks begin shooting out of its head and it
19690\springs to life in a mad berserkened rage!

19700\And with that, the guardian charges in a fury of flames and sparks!
19705*\Trying to recall the meaningless jumble of the insane Savant, you
19706\write what you can remember onto a piece of parchment, sensing
19707\that it might hold some vital clue...
19710*\You descend into a large cavern, cold and dry...
19711\@The ground shows traces of the brown icky goo that seems to
19712\follow in the wake of passing T'Rang, an indication that they
19713\probably frequent the area...
19715*\Several large capped vats are stored in the corner of the
19716\cavern...
19720*\2100
19721\What do you do?
19722\PRY OPEN A VAT
19723\LEAVE THEM
19725*\Standing at the vats, you notice a dried grey crust has formed
19726\around their lips...
19730*\Prying open a vat, you immediately succumb to the horrible wafting
19731\aroma of fermenting bug juice, stock for the pukey T'Rang gruel...
19740*\You arise from the cavern into an old crumbling chamber, fallen
19741\with age and appearing to have been vacant for many, many years...
19745*\Outside, the area has grown tall with weeds and dry grass...
19750*\You enter a long lost courtyard, whose rampant weeds have created
19751\a thicket of brush...
19752\@Appearing from the center of the thicket, a forgotten statue
19753\stubbornly stands defiant, as if refusing to be covered over
19754\despite its bygone abandonment...
19760*\Standing at the statue, it appears less sinister than before...
19761\@The stone looks fresh, as if it were carved only yesterday,
19762\although a thick layer of rust around its base suggests
19763\it has been here a long time...
19764\@Gazing up into the face of the majestic figure, you detect
19765\a faint smile and its eyes seem to almost twinkle...
19770*\Scraping off the thick rust, you unearth a metal plate at
19771\the foot of the statue engraved as follows:
19772\!THE CREATOR
19775*\Digging up the grounds surrounding the statue, you unearth a
19776\tiny crystal figurine, apparently buried here long ago...
19777\@Evgraved upon its base you discern the following: &
19778\TYDNAB EMYT
19780*\Inside the inner room of the Savant the lights of the controllers come on and off.
19781\You start to prepare to fight back, but before they could all come at you, one of the controller made a loud noise.
19790*\You approached the large machine and saw an empty slot from which the controller had removed a small device.
19791*\It must have been broken.
19800*\From out of the shadows a menacing spider like creature
19801\approaches you and hisses, "I am Shritis T'Rang!" 
19802\Standing nine feet tall, limbs twice the girth
19803\of any other T'Rang, brown cobweb coating so thick and dark,
19804\you know that this is no ordinary T'Rang, and the hot fetid spewel
19805\which drools from his mouth makes his threatening disposition even
19806\more ominous... 
19807\He hisses again,... 
19808\Be quick about you humans, I do not play games...
19810*\NO/YES/
19811\
19812\H'Jenn-Ra has sent you to me?
19815*\H'Jenn-Ra T'Rang waits for you!
19820*\Then take heed little pups... 
19821\The T'Rang Empire has claimed this world as its purlieu,
19822\and any outsiders mettling in our affairs will be dealt with
19823\in a most expedient manner... 
19824\If H'Jenn-Ra T'Rang wishes to test your merits, I will oblige... 
19825\But cross us,
19826\and the full force of the T'Rang Empire will ring down upon
19827\your clammy little heads!
19830*\STRIKE/-STAND DOWN/
19831\
19832\What word has H'Jenn-Ra T'Rang for Shritis?
19835*\I do not believe you! 
19840*\To strike?!... 
19841\Does he wish your heads devoured by the great Shritis T'Rang?! 
19842\HA HA HA... 
19843\Fear not, disgusting humans... 
19844\It is the fat bellies of the nosey Umpani toads we would purge
19845\from our territories... 
19846\They bring their fierce guns and machines to bear against all
19847\who oppose them, but they fear the mighty T'Rang Empire, yes! 
19848\Even with all their firepower they cannot prevail against us! 
19849\The Watchers must sense a momentary weakness in their defenses,
19850\and the wise H'Jenn-Ra has determined now is the time to let
19851\them feel the vengeful claw of the T'Rang! 
19852\Perhaps H'Jenn-Ra has seen within you a power to assist us...
19855*\NO/YES/
19856\
19857\Would you partake of my vengeance upon the cow bellied Umpani?
19860*\HSSSTTT BAH! H'Jenn-Ra sends me worthless plasm... 
19861\Return to him and tell him Shritis T'Rang has no use for your
19862\cowardly spines!
19865*\So H'Jenn-Ra may have chosen shrewdly after all... 
19866\He is wise... 
19867\Perhaps too wise... 
19868\You are to seek out the savage Umpani tracker, Rodan Lewarx,
19869\and destroy him! 
19870\Around his neck hangs the gold medallion of his dead father... 
19871\Bring the medallion to me! 
19872\And you shall reap the rewards befitting proven allies of
19873\the T'Rang Empire! 
19874\Do not return to me until Lewarx lies a festering carcass! 
19875\I go to sever the head of the Umpani,... 
19876\...the simpering pig, General Yamo!
19880*\=916,=917,When dealing with an unpredictable and dangerous power, each moment
19881\becomes an exacting test, as if the boundary between reward and
19882\crucifixion lay upon the keen edge of a sword's blade...
19883\@In the battlefield, such experiences are commonplace...
19884\@But how much more deadly when the contest lies within innocuous
19885\surroundings, and the wars are fought with words...
19886\@It is with a sense of relief then that you watch as the great
19887\monsterous spider thing known as Shirtis T'Rang gathers his forces
19888\and exits the chamber, off on his crusade of assassination, hissing
19889\orders to those who follow in his putrescent wake, oblivious any
19890\longer to your lingering presence in the house...
19891\@Now it is for you to decide your next course of action...
19895*\Apparently, so enthralled was Shritis with his mission that he
19896\neglected to secure this old chest...
19897\@Of course, mayhaps it too be another test...
19900*\Examining the contents of the box, you find the stuffed corpse
19901\of a Savant Guardian, skin completely shriveled, hard as a bone,
19902\and most sincerely dead...
19903\@You puzzle as to why it did not vaporize like all the others upon
19904\its demise...
19905\@While sifting through the body, however, a thin black wafer falls
19906\to the floor...
19910*\Within the chest you find a long stemmed spade like polearm, an
19911\old set of oily leather gloves, and a small bottle of spirits...
19915*\The yard is damp and gloomy, having a distinct aroma about it...
19916\@It is then that you realize just what this weed ridden garden
19917\really is, and what all the engraved slabs sticking up from the
19918\soddy ground represent...

19980*\Digging up the grave, you unearth an old rotted coffin containing

19985*\Digging up the grave, you unearth an old rotted coffin containing
19986\a rather well preserved corpse of some bizarre creature... 
19987\!Oh oh! The bones begin to rattle!
19990*\The ground is somewhat soggy here, and the entire area seems to
19991\be sagging into the earth...
19995*\Digging up the grave, the mushy ground beneath you collapses!
20000*\Walking through the forest you begin to feel a bit apprehensive,
20001\an odd sense of your general surroundings which seems to emanate
20002\an ominous scowl of doom...
20005*\The foreboding aura of the woods seems to be getting stronger, and
20006\you glance about as if hidden eyes were watching you...
20010*\A slight rustle of the leaves, a strange crackling of branches,
20011\all is definitely not as it appears...
20015*\And then without warning, the trees begin to move...
20020*\BAHHL GRAAAG... 
20021\THEY APPROACH THE SACRED GROVE! 
20022\CKALLOK BAA GOGGG!!
20025*\The sinister presence of the forest growing stronger, the danger has
20026\not yet passed...
20030*\A ring of columned stones encircles a clearing in the grove, and
20031\you approach with great caution...
20032\@At the center of the ring you can see a flat stone carving of some
20033\kind, an engraved slab upon the ground...
20034\@All feels strangely still for a moment...
20035\@Then looking around, you perceive the forest creeping in upon you...
20036\@Slowly, very slowly...
20037\@As your foot moves to take a step, the trees are upon you...
20040*\Silently, the masses of the verdurous sylvan denizens continue
20041\their onslaught...
20045*\As if no end in sight, the stalking vegetable man trees still come,
20046\dark, looming, and mindless...
20050*\Then it is over...
20051\@The forest still once again...
20052\@But you suspect that it is only a matter of time before more of the
20053\tree things can come to protect their grove, and for whatever unknown
20054\reasons, you now know that to remain here could only result
20055\in your inevitable and ultimate demise...
20060*\Stepping upon the large stone tablet you study its features, a
20061\depiction of a great towering tree, thousands of branches thickly
20062\sprouting from it, and upon its trunk an old and gnarled face...
20080*\Placing the small potted tree upon the face of the stone carving,
20081\you step back...

20105*\Then into a small twig... 
20107*\=E99.0, Finally becoming a tiny root... 
20109*\And then into nothingness... 
20115*\The small pot lies broken upon the stone face of the engraved slab,
20116\its dirt spilled onto the ground...
20140*\Walking out from the bungalows, you reflect upon the wild
20141\construction of edifaces and interconnecting tunnels from which
20142\you have emerged, marveling at the complexity of its apparent
20143\random design...
20144\@It seems likely that the intricate structure was composed from the
20145\stones of the old village ruins, for the other half the fallen
20146\city lies barren, little more than an open field of wild grass and
20147\brush...
20150*\Scattered bones make grisly piles along the husk of the ruins, as
20151\if dumped here once the meat from their carcasses had been picked
20152\clean...
20155*\From among the bones you discern a varied assortment of cannibalized
20156\creatures, some clearly beast, others more human, and even a few
20157\skulls resembling the rodent shaped heads of the rat men...
20160*\Charred logs and embers from a bonfire lie within a circle of
20161\stones here, and though the fire has long extinguished, the ground
20162\underneath still possesses a slight warmth...
20163\@It makes you wonder what kind of bizarre ritual might transpire
20164\here amongst the ratmen, and you imagine swarms of the furry little
20165\creatures in the light of a full moon, dancing wildly about the
20166\roasting body of a recent prey, tiny mouths drooling with ecstasy
20167\in anticipation of their forthcoming meal...

20173\clownish face stares out with a banana like smile...
20175*\There is a hollow pin protruding where the clown's nose should be...
20177*\You stick the red rubber ball on the clown's nose pin... 
20178\Giving the red nose a squeeze, you detect an unmistakable click...
20180*\The funhouse is quite weathered, and covered with dusty webs...
20181\@You surmise that it has not been occupied for many years...
20182\@At least not by anything human...
20185*\Entering the room, you stumble over piles of fallen debris
20186\cluttering the floor...
20190*\You find nothing but the remains of old wooden props and
20191\stands, and guess that it's probably been quite some time since
20192\any kind of circus gave a performance around here...
20195*\Corroded boxes and crates lie collapsed in heaps of rot and dust,
20196\and the promise of finding anything useful looks doubtful...
20200*\Much to your surprise, an old chest sits quietly in the back of the
20201\room, idly passing the years awaiting the return of its owner...
20205*\At the rear of the chamber lies a solid metal pyramid,
20206\forged of black iron, and well capable of withstanding
20207\the onslaught of centuries...
20210*\Embedded atop the pyramid is a large steel hook, and embossed
20211\upon its face is the numeral 200...
20212\@Attempting to lift the weight, you find that the years
20213\haven't shaved off more than a gram or two, if that
20214\much...
20220*\Entering the central chamber, you spot a descending shaft from
20221\which arises a ladder of questionable integrity...
20222\@You wonder whether it will be able to hold your weight without
20223\collapsing...
20225*\The ladder somehow managed to hold up bending, distorting. Though it creaks it didn't break.
20230*\#!Bertie's

20237\@In the air are wisping traces of a light down, and in the corner
20238\you spot several stuffed bags which all seem to be sporting
20239\holes coughing forth the feathery flotilla...
20240\@In the back of the room, you also perceive a number of bows mounted
20241\upon the wall, each of various size and shape...
20242\@From underneath a rumple of sticks and feathers, a small chittering
20243\furried fellow pops up and immediately starts a frenzied rant

20340*\Carefully stepping into the open chamber, your eyes note
20341\a peculiar darkness, which fills the room like a smokey
20342\cloud...
20345*\#!BARLONE'
20346\!ORDER OF TAW
20350*\You can hear quiet whispering chits coming from somewhere nearby...
20351\@You do not understand what is being said, or whether they are
20352\aware of you presence...
20355*\Hmmm, so much for the element of surprise...
20360*\Entering the room, you face a mob of husky Rattkin,
20361\weapons drawn and ready, but not yet moving into action...
20362\@In the still of the moment, you quickly assess your opponents...
20363\@Their fur is dark and well groomed... And though they exude a
20364\somewhat sinister ethos, there is a subtle strange charisma about
20365\them...
20366\@They seem quite confident, and most of all, demonstrate an obvious
20367\interest in you and in watching your reactions...
20368\@It is then that you recognize the nature of these creatures...
20369\@They are members of an underworld...
20370\@But not a gang of thugs, no...
20371\@These creatures are well organized, meticulous, and possess a
20372\razor sharp intellect... @Honed by years of strict orthodoxy...
20373\@Upper eschelon corsairs, studying their mark, noting your
20374\strengths and weaknesses... @Silently forming the noose by which
20375\to profit from your eventual hanging...
20376\@Finally, your eyes meet those of a Rattkin who appears to have an
20377\icy mask of death etched across his face...
20378\@And he begins to speak in a low hoarse whisper...
20390*\=910,Allow me to introduce myself...

20402*\Gensuda'...
20405*\As I was saying, my friends and I have an interesting proposal
20406\which we want you to consider... 
20407\We can do many things for you... 
20408\And we want you to do us a small favor in return... 
20409\We know about you and the others... 
20410\We've seen the machines that breathe fire and move through the
20411\sky... 
20412\Long ago there were others that had these machines... 
20413\The Higardi... 
20414\But they are gone now... 
20415\We know that you have come from a world beyond the sky... 
20416\And we wish to expand our operations...

20418\And in return our organization will assist you... 
20420*\NO/YES/
20421\
20422\Do we have a deal?
20425*\What's the matter, you don't trust us? 
20426\There are two kinds in the world, my friends... 
20427\The living... and the dead... 
20428\The dead dwell in fear, and search for safety and comfort... 
20429\Always following the rules... 
20430\Never taking the chance to do anything which might
20431\bring about uncertain change... 
20432\But the living seek otherwise... 
20433\They brave the edge over which lies unknown and dangerous
20434\new discovery... 
20435\Knowing that to become complacent is to become inanimate... 
20436\Come back when you decide to enjoin the living...
20440*\I see you have reconsidered our offer...
20445*\This is a good day for us... 
20446\What we ask is something simple... 
20447\There is a flying machine which descends into the old ruins of
20448\Nyctalinth... 
20449\Our scouts have seen it come and go many times... 
20450\Find out when the flying machine will be at Nyctalinth again... 
20451\This is a small favor we ask of you... 
20452\Once you do this thing, return to me... 
20453\And I'll tell you where you can find one of the maps... 
20454\I know all about the maps... 
20455\You do this small favor for us... 
20456\And we'll help you get the maps... 
20457\I think our business is concluded for today... 
20458\You've made a wise decision to work with us...

20472\When can we expect the next flying ship at Nyctalinth?
20475*\Excuse us for a moment...
20480*\We don't find your trick amusing... 
20481\It's obvious that you can't be trusted...
20485*\Yes, that is possible... 
20486\You've done well... 
20487\In the New City there is a passage that leads to the old
20488\Archives... 
20489\A piece of the map was put there by a friend of the family... 
20490\As a small personal favor... 
20491\We may have another favor you can do for us later... 
20492\We'll let you know...
20500*\Emerging from a small alcove, an odd looking Rattkin wearing dark
20501\specatcles and tapping a wooden cane slowly hobbles out to meet
20502\you...
20510*\Coins for the blind... 
20511\Coins for the blind... 
20515*\NO/YES/
20516\
20517\Kind Sirs, could you spare a few coins for the unfortunate?
20520*\=909,Pah! May the Razuka treat you so fairly! 
20521\And the old blind Rattkin scurries back into his alcove,
20522\surprisingly quick in light of his condition...
20525*\The old blind Rattkin embraces you, patting you on the back,
20526\and exclaims,... 
20527\May your generous souls be equally rewarded! 
20528\A sudden pleasant sensation comes over you, the good feeling
20529\that aspires from assisting others in need, and you are left
20530\basking with a tingling lightness of being...
20535*\=931,Ah! I recall same generous footsteps not too long passed... 
20536\How fair thee this day, noble sirs?
20540*\Oddly enough, though Old Blienmeis obviously flinched at your
20541\clumsy attempt to rifle through his pocket, he makes no sudden
20542\outburst or cry, but instead stands callously hunched as if
20543\fallen into a slight stupor... 
20544\Protuding from one of his pockets, a small ring dangles enticingly,
20545\caught slightly in the fold of a kerchief where you had fumbled
20546\it a moment ago... 
20547\It seems almost to bulge out at you, ready to hop into your hand,
20548\and sensing the moment, you quickly snatch it up, before it can
20549\fall to the ground with a tell tale tinkle...
20555*\A cool breeze crosses by you, and Old Blienmeis turns to
20556\face the sky, saying... 
20557\Weather seems to be turning, eh?! 
20558\And with that he quickly retreats into the alcove, hands over his
20559\head for cover as if protecting himself from invisible droplets of
20560\rain...
20565*\Glad to hear you...
20566\Be hearing you!

20575*\From behind the heavy oaken door a muffled voice calls out...
20576\@"Only genuine thieves, rouges, and brigands may enter...
20577\@If you would prove yourself, stick your hands through the
20578\window!
20580*\The room is vacant, though adorned with old chains and burnt torches...
20582*\They say it was created by an ancient Rattkin Magi...
20585*\Stay away from there!
20587*\Ooo, that tickles!!
20590*\1500
20591\Do you put your hand through the window?
20592\PUT HANDS THROUGH
20593\KEEP HANDS AWAY
20595*\You approach the window, debating the wisdom of honoring the
20596\dangerous request...
20600*\Gritting your teeth, you insert your hands through the bars of the
20601\window...
20602\@Small furry paws quickly race over your hands, as if probing them
20603\in some secret ritual of divination...
20605*\Neechht! 
20606\Look at these sad gimpers! 
20607\You couldn't steal from a dink if he was blind! 
20608\Come back when you've had more practice...
20610*\Ah! You wear the mark of the Guild upon your finger! 
20611\Enter herein, fellow purlionettes!
20615*\Entering the dimly lit shoppe, you make out the form of a
20616\familiar figure standing before you...
20620*\It warms my cockles to hear your footsteps again... 
20621\I must confess, however, that your skills are quite lacking... 
20622\Crude, weak, pathetic, ineffective, sluggish, oaffy... 
20623\Not to mention obvious... 
20624\What you need is help... 
20625\And lots of it!
20630*\They say the Razuka operate out of the old Funhouse... 
20631\It's dangerous to do business with the Razuka... 
20632\One little mistake, and well... 
20633\Let's just say that old Blienmeis wasn't always Blienmeis... 
20634\But if you want to get inside, Blienmeis will help... 
20638*\Tch! You haven't the jingle!
20640*\NO/YES/
20641\
20642\Will you pay 1000 gold pieces for a nose?
20645*\This will get you inside, but after that you're on your own...
20650*\The Ring of Reflextion contains a very special power... 
20651\Created by an ancient Rattkin Magi long ago... 
20652\I have but one, and it comes at a great price... 
20655*\NO/	YES/
20656\
20657\Will you pay 12000 gold pieces for it?
20660*\You must invoke the magic of the ring to transfer its power...
20665*\Perhaps you will change your mind later...
20670*\Barging into the room, you interrupt a gang of rousey Rattkin
20671\polishing their swords and sharpening their daggers...
20672\@As they revel in their succulent good fortune at your foolhardy
20673\intrusion, a big fat ugly Rattkin in the back shouts out,...
20674\@"Look what the cat's dragged in, boys! 
20675\Let's clean 'em!!
20750*\The interior of the Funhouse appears gloomy and decrepit, lacking
20751\any festive spirit whatsoever...
20752\@You begin to suspect rather devious connotations in the word,
20753\"Fun"...
20755*\=P3,Mounted to the wall, a spinning fan whirls round and round, blowing
20756\a gusty wind...
20760*\Lying underneath a pile of rubble on the floor, you discover a
20761\tarnished key...
20765*\Mounted upon the wall are two blocks which support short steel
20766\cylinders, each with a hook... 
20767\Two metal blades are attached to an end of one
20768\cylinder, and you find that it spins around quite freely...
20770*\You stretch the elastic band between the two hooked
20771\cylinders and wind it up... 
20772\The blades spin around as the band unwinds, emitting a cool
20773\and steady breeze...
20780*\Before you, a cascade of troughs turns beneath an
20781\open shaft, and you are cautious lest you accidently fall in...
20785*\You brazenly step into the cascading troughs...
20790*\The cascading troughs spin you around and downward, slamming
20791\you into the solid bars of a closed steel gate...
20795*\Having no escape from the rotating troughs, you are dumped
20796\into the darkness below...
20800*\The cascading troughs spin you around and downward, flinging
20801\you into the open corridor ahead...
20803*\In the shaft ahead is a moving belt, which arises from below...
20805*\=J0,Atop the moving belt, it propels you into the hallway...
20807*\Oops! 
20808\You accidently pried the candle sconce loose from the wall!
20810*\A thin veneer of water skates rapidly down a descending channel,
20811\and you wonder at its purpose...
20812\@The water being only a few inches thick, you touch beneath its
20813\surface to discover a slick and slippery bottom...
20814\@At least it isn't deep enough to worry about getting in over
20815\your heads...
20818*\Entering the water, you slide down the flue...
20820*\An odd transparent dome protrudes from a narrow shaft a
20821\few steps in front of you...
20825*\=S21.0, =E9.10,Looking closer at the dome, you note a gaping hole in its face... 
20826\It appears to be a hollow tube of some sort...
20830*\The heavy black ball rests inside the tube, perched upon a
20831\thick plate...
20835*\=E9.11,You drop the ball into the dome, making a loud
20836\thud as it lands on a plate inside the tube...
20840*\A large spool stands mounted over an open shaft, and attached
20841\to it is a heavy metal chain...
20845*\The chain is wound up onto the spool...
20850*\The chain is hanging down the shaft...
20855*\=E8.11, Attaching the handle to the spindle of the spool, you crank up
20856\the chain as far as it will go...
20860*\Lying under an old broken skull, you retrieve an unusual object...
20862*\The chamber appears to be an old burial crypt, filled with bones...
20863\@Even more disturbing, however, is that some of them are moving...
20865*\Looking down the passage, you face a row of gaping pits which
20866\travels the length of the corridor... 
20867\At the end of the pits stands a round pillow target,
20868\bearing circles of various colors and a crimson bull's eye...
20872*\You leap into the gaping pit...
20875*\You heave the painted ball down the passage towards the target...
20880*\Missing the bull's eye, the ball bounces off the target and falls
20881\back into the pit at the end of the corridor...
20885*\BULL'S EYE!
20890*\A round target stands mounted on the floor, and
20891\down the north corridor is a row of large gaping pits...
20892\@To the west, a cascade of troughs goes round and round, dumping
20893\empty air into the darkness below it...
20895*\Up ahead, a wide moving belt ascends from a shaft in the floor,
20896\rising steadily upward and into the ceiling...
20900*\=J3,Up you go!
20910*\Perched over the shaft, you hear the sound of rushing water far
20911\below...
20915*\Examining the shaft, you note a pair of grooved notches which
20916\lie on each side of its width, as if made to hold something
20917\which spanned across it...
20920*\=G16.0, You insert the roped bar into the grooves which span the shaft,
20921\and let the rope fall below...
20925*\=G16.0, A thick rope hanging from a bar spanning the shaft dangles below...
20930*\NO/YES/
20931\
20932\Do you climb back up the rope?
20935*\=G17.0, Grabbing onto the rope, you find no where to go other than to
20936\drop below or climb back up...
20940*\A thick transparent wall allows viewing, but not access, to a wide
20941\channel of rushing water...
20950*\Examining the wall, you peer through a narrow hole bored all the
20951\way through it, and discern a glimmer of light coming from the
20952\other side...
20955*\You insert the long wooden dowel into the hole, a snug fit, and
20956\shove it all the way in...
20957\@But nothing happens...
20960*\Launched upward through the shaft, you grab nothing but thin air and
20961\quickly fall back from whence you arose...
20965*\=J0,Launched upward through the shaft, you grab hold of a long wooden
20966\dowel protruding from the wall... 
20967\You shimmey across the dowel into the adjoining corridor...
20980*\From the chest you extract a thick wide elastic band,
20981\strong and quite rubbery...
20990*\=P2,A long plank, secured to a pivot block, rests underneath an
20991\open shaft in the ceiling...
20995*\=E7.2,Hanging from the shaft is a long heavy metal chain...
21000*\=E7.3,A black pyramid is hooked to the end of the heavy chain, and it
21001\is poised over the end of the plank...
21005*\With a heave and a grunt you hoist the black pyramid up and hook
21006\it on to the end of the chain...
21010*\=P2,Stepping onto the plank, your end pivots to the floor, but nothing
21011\else happens...
21015*\Stepping onto the plank, your end pivots to the floor, triggering
21016\a switch underneath it... 
21020*\A heavy chain suddenly drops from the ceiling over the other end of
21021\the plank, but nothing else happens...
21025*\A weighty pyramid suddenly drops onto the other
21026\end of the plank, catapulting you into the air...
21030*\Having achieved the remarkable elevation of almost four feet,
21031\everyone is sent sprawling in all directions, falling to the ground
21032\with thuds and groans...
21035*\You douse yourselves with the mysterious potion, and soon feel
21036\tingley, and as light as a feather...
21040*\=J2,Being reduced to featherweights, you are hurled upward through the
21041\shaft above the plank...
21045*\=J2,Still propelled from your launch, you continue sailing upwards...
21050*\=J0,Arising up through the shaft, you are hit by a gusty blast of wind,
21051\which, in your lightweight condition, blows you across the corridor
21052\like little fat balloons...
21055*\Arising up through the shaft, you momentarily hang poised, then
21056\grope, and then plumment back down the open shaft beneath you...
21060*\=J1,This just isn't your dayyyyy...
21065*\Everyone is sent sprawling in all directions, falling to the ground
21066\with thuds and groans...
21070*\Standing up from your miraculous flight, you feel your normal weight
21071\quickly returning...
21075*\Lying on the floor is a fist sized wooden ball, painted with brightly
21076\colored circles and a star...
21080*\Grabbing onto the rope so conveniently dangling from above, your
21081\momentum swings you across the water duct...
21085*\=E10.2,Resting on the pad is an odd black ball,
21086\about the size of an ogre's head and almost as pretty...
21090*\On the floor in front of you lies a square plate, large enough
21091\for everyone to crowd onto it...
21092\@Behind the plate you can see the outline of a transparent tube,
21093\sticking down from a shaft in the ceiling...
21095*\=E10.10, Stepping onto the plate, you note the pad directly underneath
21096\the end of the tube... 
21097\It appears to be connected to the plate as a kind of trigger
21098\mechanism...
21100*\=E10.10, Inspecting the tube, you see the pad underneath it
21101\is poised to catch anything that falls down the chute...
21110*\=E10.11, Stepping onto the plate, you hear a slight click... 
21111\A large black ball drops down the hollow tube, landing
21112\in the pad beneath it...
21115*\Suddenly the entire plate shoots skyward, propelling you up the
21116\open shaft directly overhead...
21120*\You fall back through the shaft and land with a crash upon the
21121\plate...
21125*\Coiled in the corner you discover a short thick rope, which is
21126\securely tied to a hefty bar...
21130*\SIX SPEARS

21134\SECOND
21135\THIRD
21136\FOURTH
21137\FIFTH
21138\SIXTH
21140*\Upon the wall is a set of tall metal spears, mounted in a single row
21141\with a long rivet through the center...
21142\@There are six spears in all, arranged in a circular pattern,
21143\and you discover that they can swing around on the rivet which
21144\pins them together...
21145\@Looking a bit closer, it appears to be an elaborate mechanism of
21146\some kind, each spear rotating a different gear which is in turn
21147\connected to more gears and so on...
21148\@There is nothing which indicates a purpose to the spears, or
21149\what the contraption actually does, although it appears likely
21150\that it is a locking mechanism of some kind, designed to open
21151\if the spears are turned in a specific combination...
21160*\Lo, inside the chest you find an old preserved piece of
21161\parchment, carefully bundled in waxed wrappings...
21165*\Lo, inside the chest is naught but a pile of empty wax wrapping...
21170*\You emerge from the Funhouse to find yourself in the forest,
21171\somewhere outside the nearby Rattkin ruins...
21175*\The forest has grown through the cumbling ruins, and appears to
21176\have choked off the main entry...
21177\@Perhaps there is another way...
21180*\Passing the tree, you notice that an anomaly of nature has arranged
21181\the gnarls and knots of its rippled bark into the likeness of a face,
21182\and one that possesses a gloaty smug smile at that...
21185*\It is then that you witness the woody countenance make a wink, and
21186\momentarily numbed by the surprising event, find yourself seized
21187\securely within its grasping branches...
21190*\Before you can react, you are hoisted up into the tree, shuffled
21191\and passed from branch to branch, and finally deposited into a
21192\crude and weathered bungalow, apparently either built into the
21193\top of the tree or overhanging it in some fashion...
21194\@The place looks completely abandoned...
21200*\Oops, not quite completely abandoned!
21205*\The squat furry Rattkins seemed most surprised and disturbed by your
21206\appearance, and no doubt word of your arrival is quickly spreading
21207\throughout their squirrelly network...
21210*\Passing by the gnarled faced tree, its makes a sly wink, seizing
21211\you within its grasping branches and hoisting you up...
21215*\Grabbing onto the branches at the top of the tree, you climb down
21216\to the ground below...

21330*\You are standing atop a sheer cliff, and below you the trees of

21335*\The craggy face of the mountain side offers little hope of being

21337\rope, lassoed around a boulder and dangling down the precipice,
21338\suggesting that someone has attempted the descent before...
21339\@Unfortunately, the dried rope crumbles at the touch, eliminating
21340\it as a viable means of support...
21345*\Securing the long cord of spliced vines to a boulder at the cliff's
21346\edge, you peer down and notice that it seems to reach the ground...
21347\@It sure looked alot further a few moments ago...
21350*\Dropping the vine down the side of the cliff, you see that it is
21351\still too short to reach the forest below...

21380*\You stand at the base of a steep sheer cliff, almost straight up
21381\and certainly impossible to scale or climb...
21382\@It appears to ascend all the way into the heavens...

21405*\From a tree hang long thick vines, growing across
21406\the ground and up the mountain, hundreds of feet long...
21410*\The vines appear supple and sturdy, but cling so gently to the
21411\mountain face that a quick yank parts them from their grasp,
21412\tumbling them back upon you to the ground in a heap...
21450*\A sudden cold chill rushes through you as you come to the edge

21465*\Peering through the lens of the Necromatic Helm, you stand witness
21466\to a host of colorful ghostly visages as they dance and dart
21467\about the supernatural field...
21468\@They seem to be encircling something, and you notice that
21469\they make occasional thrusts and lunges into the center of the
21470\circle, which is immediately followed by an anguished scream of
21471\pain, coming from as yet some unknown other creature...

21508\helplessly as she writhes at their touch, fading again out of view...
21510*\Suddenly in the sky you see a soaring black bird, pursued by a flock
21511\of demonic flying creatures...

21575*\A cold shiver suddenly passes through you... 
21576\But you see nothing...

21582\As if wanting something from you... 
21583\Then it becomes angry and charges, a grimacing demon... 
21584\Its face becomes like death and it enters into you... 
21585\Only to disappear and leave you cold, so very cold...
21590*\A strange sound can be heard from somewhere distant... 
21591\It sounds like a woman, crying... 
21592\Then it sounds like it is calling out to someone... 
21593\And then turns into a spoken whisper... 
21594\But it is too faint for you to make out the words...
21600*\The Witch's Tale
21601\!Once upon a time there was a goodly witch by the name of
21602\Hilynda, who was very powerful and beautiful. She lived high
21603\upon a mountain top, and ruled all the lands below her as far as
21604\the eye could see. Being a fair and just witch, she was provider
21605\and benefactor to all the animals dwelling within her domain,
21606\and often appeared to passing strangers in times of need. She
21607\had been borne of parents who also were witches, and had inherited
21608\the power to foretell the future, a very rare and special gift, even
21609\for a witch. But coming from a family of witches, she was not an
21610\only child. Four sisters, envious of her beauty and jealous of her
21611\power, also lived in the mountains. And as every day passed, they
21612\became more and more resentful of her popularity and her goodness.
21613\So the four sisters banded together, and decided that they would
21614\undo all the good that Hilynda had done, and torment her, and
21615\be just as nasty as they could. And the four sisters took upon
21616\themselves the names of the North, the South, the East, and the
21617\West, so that they would cover all the lands around them and
21618\insure that no foul deed would go undone. But for every dirty
21619\trick, for every heinous crime, for every little bit of badness
21620\that they could do, Hilynda was always there to thwart them, and
21621\turn their horrible deeds into good ones. For remember, Hilynda
21622\could see into the future and always knew what her sisters were
21623\going to do, even before they themselves knew! And so the day
21624\finally came when the four sisters said enough was enough and
21625\the time had come for them to put a stop to Hilynda once and
21626\for all. One night, while Hilynda lay sleeping, dreaming of
21627\good things, they sneaked into her chamber and invoked a
21628\terrible magic spell upon her; they cast a spell to steal her
21629\face! Her beautiful face, her nose, her
21630\mouth, her ears and her enchanted eyes, were severed and plucked
21631\from her; and each of the sisters took a part of Hilynda's
21632\face, so that then they would all have a share of their sister's
21633\magical power, and of her beauty. But Hilynda was wise to them,
21634\and had foreseen what her sisters had been planning to do,
21635\and that night, before she slept, she annointed
21636\herself with a special potion, which turned her face into gold!
21637\And when her mouth, her nose, her ears, and her eyes were
21638\stolen, it did not hurt her and she did not die; and because
21639\her features were no longer of flesh and blood, each of the four
21640\sister's own face was replaced with a part of gold. But Hilynda
21641\was cut off from the outside world, alone, and with no face.
21642\The four sisters now rule the mountains, and terrorize the
21643\surrounding lands, and do all kinds of horrible things. And
21644\to repay Hilynda for her cleverness, and cursing them with
21645\a feature of gold, every night they torment her, sending demons
21646\and spooks and ghouls and fiends to poke and tear at her, and
21647\make her feel just awful. They say that the five sisters still
21648\live in those mountains, and that every night, just before
21649\the witching hour, if you look through a witching glass, you can
21650\see the spirits come down into the forest, dancing
21651\their dance of torture, cruelty and pain around Hilynda, and that
21652\to this very day she still roams the mountains, waiting for someone
21653\to make her whole and beautiful again, waiting for someone to
21654\bring back her face.
21655\!!The End
21660*\Opening the ancient chest, you uncover a package of sealed waxy

21737\Dragon's wings and ogre's blood, what name be under North Witch hood?
21740*\Upon calling out the name, a wild pandemonium of hisses and
21741\colored vapors suddenly erupts before you... 
21742\From the billow of swirling fumes is revealed the figure of
21743\a raving witch...
21750*\Thou that calls my name, shall know thy bane!
21755*\NO/YES/
21756\
21757\Wilt thou fill my hold, with 1000 coins of gold?
21760*\The prophesy be done! 
21761\A pillar of smoke engulfs the witch, becoming blindingly white... 
21762\Your eyes become transfixed upon it and watch as another form
21763\appears within...
21765*\Thou knowest this form?
21770*\The crumpled body of the fallen figure slowly begins to transform
21771\amidst swales of darkly mists...
21772\@Soon to reveal the bloody corpse of the raving witch...
21773\@Dissolving into an etherial vapor, it eventually dissipates
21774\into the hushed air, leaving naught but a small shiny object on the
21775\cavern floor...
21780*\In death shall you meet, and in death shall he be victorious! 
21781\Then suddenly the figure attacks!
21785*\Behind her darkened brow, doth lie the secret illumination! 
21786\Then suddenly the figure attacks!
21790*\In the scheme of his master, yet another game shall unfold! 
21791\Then suddenly the figure attacks!
21795*\From him shall one universe end to beget yet another! 
21796\Then suddenly the eyes of the figure begin to glow!
21800*\=G7.0, Upon the wall of the cavern hangs a mirror of black stone... 
21801\As you approach, a spectral image with no face appears within... 
21802\She lingers for an instant, and clutches something in her hand... 
21803\=G8.0, Then she points behind you, and softly fades away...
21805*\Peering behind you, there is a small dais and a bright object
21806\which was not there a moment ago...
21810*\Drawing forth to the phantom dais, the shining object resting
21811\upon it appears to be in the shape of a human head,
21812\made of solid gold, but lacking any facial features...
21813\@Just a blank, void golden head...
21815*\Touching the witch's golden ears to the sides of the gilt head,
21816\they magically meld into place...
21820*\Touching the witch's golden teeth to the gilt head,
21821\they magically meld into place...
21825*\Touching the witch's golden nose to the gilt head,
21826\it magically melds into place...
21830*\Touching the witch's golden eyes to the gilt head,
21831\they magically meld into place...
21835*\The beautiful face of the golden head now complete, a phosphorescent
21836\brume begins to coalesce around the bewitching fantata...
21840*\=P3,=E13.0,From the smokey plumes arises the full form of the golden witch,
21841\Hilynda, enchanting and radiant, and made whole again... 
21842\One hand is raised upright, in a reverent sign of peace and
21843\tranquility, and in the other burns bright a glowing pyramid,
21844\upon whose apex floats an illuminant eye... 
21845\With a voice delicate and tender she speaks: 
21846\And in thy final hour of darkness, when the battle be bloodiest
21847\and all hope becomes lost... Let this icon, this Elysiad, be
21848\thy guiding spirit, and help deliver unto thee thy place of destiny,
21849\as thee hast delivered unto me mine own... 
21850\...She then waves her hand over the divine icon and it becomes
21851\black as jet, and she places it upon the dais... 
21852\Then, speaking again, she says: 
21853\Herein this domain lies a part of thy puzzle... 
21854\For as the prophesy is fulfilled, the time has come that it be
21855\revealed... 
21856\Remember that thee dost always travel a road leading to
21857\thine own discovery... 
21858\...And in an irridescent plummage of billowing clouds, she becomes
21859\=E99.0, an ether and gently wisps away...
21865*\Picking up the obsidian tetrahedron, you feel a flowing surge of
21866\enchanted energy, which bestows a special blessing...
21870*\A slight tremor passes through the cavern, and you hear a brief
21871\rumble which soon ebbs into the quiet once more...
21880*\=P3, A great commotion of convulsing waters spews up from the center
21881\=S31.0, of the turgid pool, and you realize that to navigate the turbulence
21882\=F31, would most likely end with disaster...
21883\=G19.0, Here too, the shore is bathed in deposits of the frost white mineral,
21884\the accumulation so great that it has formed a plateau several feet
21885\high...
21890*\Ahead lies the great eruption of turbulent water, and you can
21891\feel the current starting to pull you down...
21895*\The violent tide sucks you under...
21900*\Pausing inside the cave's entrance, you glance about and listen...
21901\@You can hear a faint noise coming from somewhere not too far
21902\away, like the sound of rushing water...
21903\@And the brevity of its echoes reveal that the cave is probably
21904\fairly shallow...
21910*\Approaching the edge of the waters, you see that they are quite
21911\agitated, and are curious about the source of the pool's hefty
21912\ripples...
21913\@Deposits of a fine white powder along the bank's edge have
21914\frosted the lip of the pool, a coating likely aquired by ages
21915\of lapping waves laden with the crystalized mineral...
21920*\Picking up a small pinch of the milky shore, you sniff, then
21921\taste... Salty!
21930*\Placing the mysterious egg upon the salty bank, you stand
21931\back and wait to see what happens... 
21932\Nothing...
21940*\=P3,Placing the mysterious egg upon the salty bank, you stand
21941\back and wait to see what happens... 
21942\Nothing...
21943\at first... 
21944\And then you notice that the salt seems to be dissolving
21945\the hard stoney shell... 
21946\It is reacting with the egg, bubbling, spewing and fizzing... 
21947\
21948\=S32.0, =F32,And then it explodes!
21950*\Although powerful enough to knock you down, no one seems hurt... 
21951\In fact it was a quite gentle and almost pleasant sensation...
21955*\You stand up and begin to brush yourself off, and while doing so
21956\suddenly catch a glimpse of the magnificent creature flying directly
21957\at you from above...
21960*\=E14.2,Is he not a body, that from toil doth he bring forth sustenance? 
21961\Is he not a heart, that from anguish doth he glean understanding? 
21962\Is he not a mind, that from chaos doth he wrest order? 
21963\And is he not yet more than this, that from emptiness doth he
21964\harvest creation?
21966*\=E99.0,...Then the wonderous manifestation swoops down to the edge of the
21967\bubbling water, and flying a high arc above the uproaring sea, emits
21968\a trail of swirling colors which follows her path across it to
21969\the other side...
21971*\And she calls across the churning ocean and the colorful arch: 
21972\Think well upon this, for this be thine only key to the great
21973\riddle...
21975*\Before you shines a great rainbow arch, spanning across a pool
21976\of churning waters...
21978*\NO/YES/
21979\
21980\Do you step onto the arch?
21982*\Stepping upon the end of the rainbow arch, you magically
21983\glide across the raging pool...
21985*\A shallow pit lies in the cavern floor, filled with a sea of
21986\black slugs...
21990*\Reaching down into the pit of slugs, your hand grasps a metal rod,
21991\afloat within their oozing midst...
21992\@Extracting the hard shaft, you behold a dazzling wand...
21993\@Perhaps the creature's strange words have something to do with it...
21995*\#!Do Not Touch!
21996\!WAND MAJESTIK
21997\@An empty marble pedestal sits quietly, displaying nothing but air...
22000*\In the pitted gorge of the mountains beckons an elephantine cave,
22001\and you sense perhaps the abode of many a thumping goliath...
22002\@Maybe no one is home...
22005*\The large flowing body of water can only be an underground route of
22006\the Eyrn River, winding it's way down through the mountains...
22007\@Very convenient for the inhabitants to have a fresh water supply,
22008\as well as an easy means for disposing of waste...

22055*\Entering the gargantuan cavity, you are assailed by a horrendous

22058\And a very odd clacking noise... 
22059\GARWOOOF!!!
22065*\The malodorous cavern is littered with the rotted scum and bones of
22066\many a traveler...
22067\@Most of them flattened into the floor from repeated trampings...
22070*\Prying up the dried pulpy remnant of something once human, you are
22071\delighted to find a rather enticing looking helmet embedded into
22072\the ground beneath it, thick and strong and unscathed...
22073\@You make note of several cryptic runes engraved upon it, and
22074\are intrigued by the scarlet glass which is mounted inside covering
22075\the eye slot, also unharmed and unscratched...

22108\outstretched arm to reach in and fetch it with a little effort...

22171\@After a few whiffs, suddenly no one is looking too particularly
22172\excited at the prospect of carrying this one around...
22200*\You insert the notched shaft into the small hole...

22212\TRY TO FIX LEVER
22213\LEAVE IT ALONE
22215*\You pull the lever but nothing happens...
22216\@It appears to be broken...
22220*\Playing with the lever for awhile and getting nowhere, you eventually
22221\resort to more forceful tactics...
22222\@Pretty soon the floor is littered with pieces of hacked lever parts,
22223\everybody is yelling at everybody else, and finally you concede that
22224\some things were not meant to be...
22225\@Standing back and looking at the results of your handiwork, the
22226\poor thing teeters for a moment, and then in a last dying gasp,
22227\mercifully falls completely off the wall with a clump, most dead...
22228\@The gate, quite unaffected by all your antics, seems to silently
22229\smirk...
22235*\The candle sconce pulls out from the wall!
22240*\Emitting squeaky cries amid threatening leaps, kicks and karate
22241\chops, a ragged munk, disgusting and filthy, covered with festering
22242\sores and oozing green scabs and foaming wildly at the mouth,
22243\insanely begins to claw and bite at you...
22245*\At least the wretch is out of his misery...
22250*\Stepping into the darkness, you hear the sound of dragging
22251\footsteps...
22252\@And about six feet above your head, a hot fetid heavy breathing...
22255*\The chamber is vile and obscene, filled with more of the
22256\feculent outcasts and lost souls...
22260*\Amid yells and spells, a congregation of munks quickly form their
22261\ranks in anticipation of your uninvited intrusion, the
22262\commanding munk heading for the rear while those of agile and swift
22263\execution charge to the front... 
22264\It is then that you notice the row of coffers that they were
22265\transporting, surely filled with all kinds of black magic and
22266\unholy artifacts... 
22267\From the back of the pack you hear a darkly voice intone: 
22268\BA GA SHI TA ALLET BA RAMM! 
22269\THE FOUL VERMIN MUST DIE!
22275*\You step into the arena of a tremendous cathedral, its bizarre
22276\frescoes long faded, its papal pews submerged under a dense cesspool
22277\of stagnant water, and filled with the wrenching odor of offal and
22278\decay...
22279\@Thick molds cover much of the ceiling and chamber, and splotches
22280\of scummy mires are visible floating upon the surface of the water...
22281\@It is not a very pleasant atmosphere...
22285*\Inside the chest you remove a long bar made of steel, in which are
22286\cut many irregular notches...
22287\@If it's a code of some kind, it's a very good one...
22290*\The ancient chest is so covered with a scungey growth that it is
22291\difficult to distinguish where the box ends and the floor begins...
22292\@Obviously it has been here a long time, perhaps forgotten or
22293\thought lost after the cathedral became submerged...
22295*\Carefully opening the antediluvian locker, you find a thick bundle
22296\sealed in a waxy dressing, untouched by the years of confinement...
22297\@Inside the bundle you uncover an old book, entitled
22298\"HOLY COVENANT" and enscribed with antiquitous writing...
22299\@Opening the book, a piece of preserved parchment lies neatly
22300\folded in between two of its pages...
22302*\Opening the antediluvian locker, you find naught but the tattered
22303\remnants of a waxy covering lying on its bottom...
22304\@And then, lifting up the empty wrappings, you discover an old book,
22305\discarded as if devoid of any value...
22306\@The book is entitled, "HOLY COVENANT"...
22310*\Descending into the remains of an old abandoned mausoleum, you
22311\behold an array of statuesque figures in the shadows...
22312\@The figures do not seem to be moving, and the quiet of the crypt
22313\is so still that you suspect them to be stone carvings...
22315*\Stepping forward, cautious of the stoney silhouettes, you espy a
22316\deep pit in the center of the chamber...
22317\@It is then that you notice the figures are not stone statues at
22318\all...
22319\@Rather, they appear to be neolithic mummies, petrified over the
22320\passing of the ages...
22325*\Drawing close to an ancient corpse, you see that the intricate
22326\dust webs which gently drape its form confirm your prognosis...
22327\@Dead...
22330*\Re entering the sepulcher, you discover that the deep pit has risen
22331\up to the surface of the floor, bearing a dwarfish altar upon which
22332\sits a black globe...
22335*\Stepping up to the dark pit, you kick a loose pebble into it... 
22336\Hearing nothing, you decide to veto any suggestion which includes the
22337\words: "jump in"...

22360*\Just as the stone faced statues begin to awaken from their deep

22362\concealed underneath the globe hits your eyes, the sound of

22414\belonged to this legendary city...

22529\@The image possesses a striking allure which seems to promise an

22535\an intruding snort...

22560*\My name is Sergeant Balbrak, and I'll be your commanding officer... 
22561\As recruits of the S.T.F. you will be given special assignments...

22635\And this time don't let them escape!!
22640*\Good job! 
22641\I'll report this to General Yamo immediately... 
22642\A successful scouting mission pays 500 gold pieces... 
22643\But destroying a T'Rang spy party earns you a 5000 gold bonus...
22645*\Really? That's odd, according to one of our trackers, he reported
22646\seeing you run away from the T'Rang!
22650*\Here are your new orders...

22666\Use extreme caution and don't hang around too long... 
22667\And whatever you do, don't mention the T'Rang around Rodan!

22685*\Rodan must have taken the news well if you're still in one piece to report back to me about it... 
22686\No one around here was willing to volunteer for the mission so you got the job... 
22687\Fortunately for you, however, a few were willing to pay handsomely to escape the assignment... 
22688\Let's see, with the 350 gold courier fee... 
22689\And the 7820 gold pieces contributed by the anxious staff corps... 
22690\Your total pay comes to 8170 gold pieces... 
22691\Just as long as Rodan obeys orders and stays put... 
22692\Which brings me to your next objective... 
22693\General Yamo wants a full report from you about Rodan... Here's your orders...

23605*\Mounted to the door is a small grey box...
23606\@A row of lights on the box blink rhytmically without pattern...
23607\@Underneath the winking lights, a thin slit serves as inlet...
23610*\Inserting the card into the grey box, the lights blink twice and
23611\then remain on...
23615*\Pulling the lever, a low pitched hum fills your ears, and a
23616\faint orange glow bathes the room...
23620*\And then the tangerine light disappears...
23630*\Emerging from the tingling Humpawhammer, you discover that
23631\you are no longer in the City of the Umpani encampment, though
23632\the building is quite similar to other structures erected by
23633\them...
23634\@Bold, spacious, clean... 
23635\Then, in the next heartbeat, a blazing Umpani titan bursts into the
23636\room with muskets drawn and eyes afire!
23640*\S.T.F. NEPS, BY LOOKING AT YOU... 
23641\WELL DON'T JUST STAND THERE, LET ME SEE YOUR ORDERS!
23650*\The massive figure stands before you, nostrils flaired, probing each
23651\of you with a heated gaze that seems to make your skin sizzle... 
23652\Like children standing before some angel of the gods, your souls
23653\feel held within the grasp of his pupils, your fate hanging in the
23654\balance... 
23655\You notice that your eyes have become transfixed upon a shimmering
23656\gold medallion which lies draped across his chest, suspended there
23657\by a thick chain... 
23658\Finally, prying your eyes from the glittering emblem, you start to
23659\speak when suddenly his deep booming voice tramples your own...
23665*\NO/YES/

23667\Do you hand Rodan Lewarx your orders from Sgt. Balbrak?
23670*\NO ORDERS!??

23682\Do you give Rodan the document from General Yamo?
23685*\YOU DARE DISOBEY A DIRECT ORDER??! 
23686\SUCH TREASON IS PUNISHABLE BY DEATH!
23690*\Handing the document to Rodan, he tears it open and hastily
23691\scans it... 
23692\O SWEET JUSTICE! 
23693\SHRITIS T'RANG HERE ON THIS PUNY LITTLE SPECK OF A PLANET... 
23694\THE GREAT GOD URRHINA SMILES ON RODAN THIS DAY! 
23695\FATHER, I SHALL AVENGE YOUR DEATH!! 
23696\...Then suddenly turning to you he snaps: 
23697\TELL YAMO THAT RODAN SHALL HAVE HIS REVENGE!!! 
23698\...And with that he is gone, dropping the document at your feet,
23699\calling for his lieutenants and captains, storming out the door...
23710*\Kind of feeling a bit shiftless standing there in the empty room,
23711\you pick up the fallen document which had ordered Rodan to stay put,
23712\finally sigh, and wonder why it is that everything seems to be
23713\arranged so that no one ever does what they're supposed to do, and
23714\why it is that everything seems to end up in such a mess...
23715\@Surely not by grand design...
23716\@Couldn't be...
23720*\Urgent!
23721\!Rodan, intelligence reports have confirmed that Shritis T'Rang
23722\is planetside. I know you still carry the wound of your father's
23723\death, but the good of the Imperium comes first. Our positions
23724\are not as strong as we have been reporting, and under no
23725\circumstance can we afford to compromise our mission or engage
23726\the T'Rang forces directly at this time. Shritis can wait for
23727\now, I need you alive to direct the final assault.
23728\Lewarx, this is a direct order:
23729\!DO NOT SEEK OUT SHRITIS T'RANG UNTIL AFTER I GIVE THE
23730\COMMAND. THE IMPERIUM IS COUNTING ON OUR SUCCESS IN THIS MISSION.
23731\THE ASTRAL DOMINAE MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO FALL INTO THE HANDS

23757\@Underneath the lights on the panel is a small 3 by 3 square of nine
23758\buttons, each with a number impressed upon it...
23760*\Inside the crate, you find a strange metal case bearing this label:
23761\@COMM LINK !AUTHORIZED USAGE ONLY !SAVANT IMPERIAL LEGIONS
23762\@Opening the case, you discover a very unusual piece of equipment,
23763\with rows of metal pins extruding from the back...
23764\@The device is small enough to carry in your hand, although somewhat
23765\cumbersome and of little apparent offensive value...

23852*\#!MAP ROOM
23853\!Restricted
23855*\Several official looking Umpani are busily engaged huddled over a
23856\sprawling map table in the center of the room...
23857\@As you enter the room, a burly guard rapidly approaches...
23860*\This area is restricted... 
23861\Let's see your orders...
23865*\NO/YES/
23866\
23867\Do you show the guard your orders?
23870*\INTRUDER ALERT! 
23871\SOUND THE ALARM!!
23875*\These orders direct you to the office of General Yamo... 
23876\You're in the wrong area... 
23877\Now clear out, soldiers!
23880*\Inspecting the large maptable in the center of the room, you carefully
23881\survey the world as the Umpani reconnaissance has mapped it...
23882\@Ukpyr, the Umpani fortification is sprawling with little green
23883\triangles all around it...
23884\@A large buildup of red squares seems to be centered to the far
23885\north and west, huddled around a block of ruins...
23886\@New City, in the center of the map, has both red squares and
23887\green triangles along its edges...
23888\@Dotted over the entire map are various groupings of the green and
23889\red symbols, which you conclude most likely denote Umpani and T'Rang
23890\strongholds or troop placements...
23891\@The most interesting feature, however, lies circled in the center
23892\of the great Sea of Sorrows, the large body of water south of
23893\New City...
23894\@In the center of the Sea, a small island is circled in red and
23895\a '?' has been drawn over it...
23896\@Apparently, the Umpani believe that there is something significant
23897\about the marked island, but nothing on the map indicates anything
23898\further...
23900*\#!SECURITY
23901\!STATION
23905*\There are several desks inhabiting the small security chamber, but
23906\other than that it appears fairly vacant...
23910*\Searching through a desk you find large stacks of filed
23911\reports, far to voluminous to read at the moment, and nothing which
23912\appears to be strikingly important...
23915*\Almost by chance, however, you spot one folder marked "DETACHE
23916\STATION", and decide to open it up...
23917\@Inside are several official reports and sets of processed orders,
23918\none of which seem to reveal anything worth noting...
23919\@But then you find a card entitled "SECURITY VAULT", and underneath
23920\stamped this serial number: "2723539"
23921\@Continuing to quickly scan the documents, you find nothing else
23922\of particular interest...
23925*\#!C.I.C.I.U.F.
23926\!General Yamo
23930*\In front of the door are several burly Umpani soldiers, intent on
23931\keeping out any unauthorized trespassers...
23935*\Orders!
23940*\	NO/YES/
23941\
23942\Do you show the soldier your orders?
23945*\The general is waiting!
23950*\Standing with his back to the door, a stern Umpani officer stares
23951\blankly at the piece of paper in his hands...
23952\@With a few low snorts he appears to re read it several times, each
23953\time getting to the end with a slow shaking of his head and then
23954\staring blankly at it again...
23955\@Finally, he folds the paper up and walks over to his desk, still
23956\acting as if you were not there...
23957\@He reaches into a pocket of his coat and pulls out a small object,
23958\which suddenly begins to burn on one end...
23959\@Placing the folded paper into the tiny flame, it catches on fire
23960\and he holds firmly as it quickly turns into black ash...
23961\@As the flame reaches his hand he drops the fiery ash to the floor
23962\and with a sudden stomp transforms the carbon residue into a flurry
23963\of flying wisps...
23964\@Then he looks up and stares you in the face...
23970*\With a voice stout and calm, he begins to speak: 
23971\I am sending you on a special mission... 
23972\It will be very dangerous... 
23973\But it is a dangerous game we play... 
23974\We have intercepted one of the T'Rang shuttles... 
23975\And upon inspection discovered it full of T'Rang cells... 
23976\Fertilized T'Rang cells in incubation... 
23977\Which can only mean that the T'Rang have long term plans to
23978\infest this part of the galaxy... 
23979\The T'Rang are a hideous lot... 
23980\Laying their eggs which eventually hatch into entire colonies... 
23981\Soon decimating all other life forms and transforming
23982\a bountiful world into a cavernous network of barren waste... 
23983\They think of nothing else save spawning their own kind
23984\throughout the universe... 
23985\And they must be stopped... 
23986\I want you to stop them... 
23987\You will have to infiltrate their established network, far to the
23988\northwest in a cluster of abandoned ruins... 
23989\There must be a Queen there producing the eggs... 
23990\They would keep her quite protected... 
23991\You must find her, and destroy her... 
23992\I am sending you because our own forces are far too weak here to try
23993\any kind of direct assault, and no Umpani could possibly infiltrate
23994\them by subterfuge... 
23995\But this is how you might be able to succeed where we cannot... 
23996\The T'Rang and Umpani Empires have made a declaration of war... 
23997\Conflict on a galactic scale... 
23998\And this is only the beginning... 
23999\You must seek out the T'Rang stronghold... 
24000\And destroy the Queen! 
24001\I have a special weapon which I am going to send with you... 
24002\It is the only one we have, so you must use it carefully... 
24003\But it is powerful enough to destroy the Queen and her spore... 
24004\Wait until you are close enough to use it... 
24005\And then get out as fast as you can...
24010*\Good luck on your mission... 
24011\I, the Umpani Federation, and worlds we have not yet dreamed of,
24012\are counting on you to eliminate the T'Rang invasion... 
24013\Remember... DUTY POWER VICTORY!
24015*\...Suddenly there is a blinding explosion... 
24016\Picking yourselves up from the floor, you can feel the earth move
24017\underfoot as more explosions rip the surrounding areas outside the
24018\command post...
24020*\Looking into the rubble of the General's Headquarters, you see an
24021\arm protruding from the debris... 
24022\Quickly digging into the fallen stones, you uncover his bloody and
24023\ripped body... Gazing down upon him, you know that his time is
24024\close at end... 
24025\With a straining gasp he chokes a whisper... 
24026\Duty... Power... Victorieeeghh... 
24027\...And then the Umpani general is still and breathes no more...
24030*\Soon, the explosions cease and you can hear the sounds of Umpani
24031\soldiers shouting orders and the sounds of the dying and wounded...
24032\@The explosion that hit the Command Center has blasted the side away,
24033\and you can see into the din outside...
24034\@There is smoke, confusion and scattered Umpani everywhere...
24040*\Stepping outside, you see ranks of the mighty armsmen fleeing the
24041\town, vacating their fortress and seeking safety in the nearby
24042\forests...
24043\@Your own senses are still numbed by the shock of what has happened,
24044\but you feel that perhaps there is more here still to be uncovered...
24045\@And such an opportunity may not present itself for long...
24050*\#!SPACEPORT
24051\!AUTHORITY
24055*\Several Umpani armsmen block the entrance to the Spaceport Center,
24056\intent on keeping out unwanted or unauthorized personnel...
24060*\This area is restricted... 
24061\Present your orders...
24065*\NO/YES/
24066\
24067\Do you give the Armsman your orders?
24080*\These orders do not grant you access to the Spaceport... 
24081\Leave the area immediately or I'll have to place you under arrest...
24085*\A huge painted plat covers the inside wall of the Spaceport Center,
24086\although what you are looking at makes no sense...
24087\@It appears to be flecks and colored circles painted onto a dark
24088\blue background, with white lines and numbers scattered over it...
24090*\=931, =948,Stepping closer to the wallmap, you study its features in more
24091\detail...
24092\@Then it dawns on you...
24093\@In the center of the map is a large yellow circle...
24094\@And upon the outer edge of a concentric ring of circles around it,
24095\a tiny sphere is labelled with the following inscription: GUARDIA
24096\@And on a ring around the sphere Guardia, another small white globe
24097\has been drawn...
24098\@As if a giant sea, the air, the sky, space itself lies plotted
24099\on this amazing mural, as plainly as any skipper's navigational
24100\charts who sails the oceans...
24101\@You remember seeing such a map before, on your journey to this
24102\world, but it is only now that you begin to fathom its true
24103\meaning and purpose...
24104\@And you realize that these creatures cross the skies just as
24105\the men of your world cross the sea...
24106\@Masters of the heavens...
24107\@Glancing over the entire mural again, your brain begins turning
24108\into jelly trying to conceive of the hundreds of circles, worlds,
24109\that dot its surface, as if each were a tiny bubble afloat within
24110\a vast and infinite foam...
24111\@You read names and names and more names, trying to remember that
24112\each represents an entire planet, like your own, like Guardia,
24113\perhaps teeming with strange peoples, perhaps full of wonderous
24114\new things to behold...
24115\@How the magiks of the universe have wrought such a weave of
24116\intoxicating shores!
24117\@You turn away, no longer able to withstand these lofty thoughts...
24118\@But after a few breaths, you turn back and study the little globe
24119\Guardia once again...
24120\@A small metal pin sticks out of the map in an emtpy patch of blue
24121\near the planet, and under the pin you read the following:
24122\@HORATHA TRACKING - S:18,49 D:34,82,+17
24123\@Hmmm...
24124\@Finally, your eyes and head begin to ache, and you decide to look
24125\for an alternate source of entertainment and reading material...
24127*\Peeking in through the window, you see the back wall has been painted
24128\black, with lots of colorful speckles...
24130*\This side of the Spaceport appears to be a storeroom, filled with
24131\crates and heavy metal pieces...
24135*\Prying open a few crates, you find they contain giant metal objects,
24136\far too heavy to carry, and whose purpose is rather enigmatic...
24200*\Standing out over the treetops, the Great Tower of Dane, Dionysceus,
24201\is visible in the southern sky, a deep paled monolithic slab which
24202\rises above the forest lands with an unnatural alien majesty...
24203\@Strong and expressionless, you can almost feel within its cold stoney
24204\walls the powerful magiks which most surely reside within its holds...
24205\@And for the first time, it dawns on you just how old
24206\must be the ancient and established order of the Dane...
24207\@A sect likely as old as the planet itself...
24210*\Closer to the ominous tower, you feel a boney chill that seems to
24211\descend from its looming surface...
24215*\#!Entering
24216\!DIONYSCEUS
24217\@#!Great Tower
24218\!Of Dane
24220*\Inside the entrance of the tower, an utter lack of warmth tells
24221\you as much about the Fellowship of Dane as could any Dane himself...
24222\@It does not strike you that they are likely to provide visitors
24223\with any sense of a hearty welcome, and indeed you suspect they would
24224\be quite perplexed by any notion akin to showing one "a good time"...
24225\@But then again, perhaps it won't be dull after all...
24230*\Gathered inside the chamber, a huddle of Dane talk in
24231\soft whispers, ceasing as you enter...
24232\@Surprised at your presence, they distantly survey the party, trying
24233\to fathom your intent...
24234\@Then, bearing aught but a slit for a smile, one of them approaches...
24240*\The Fellowship of Dane welcomes ye, good brothers...
24245*\NO/YES/
24246\
24247\Hast ye heard the word?
24250*\May the divine light guide ye then...

24280*\Ah, let Fellowship enter thy hearts, good brothers, and show ye

24282\weigh upon thy purse...
24285*\Truely ye dost already see the light, fine brothers!
24290*\NO/

24291\
24292\A token shall we say, of 100 gold pieces?
24295*\Alas, poor brothers, thy faith is as weak as thy purse... 
24296\If ye cannot pass this test, then surely ye will fail in the
24297\others... 
24298\Return when ye hast gained a bit more in thy faith!
24300*\Fair offering then, Initiates! 
24301\Ye dost shine in the eyes of the Fellowship... 
24302\The Fellowship welcomes ye into its arms!
24310*\The Fellowship has many levels of attainment, ye are at the
24311\first... 
24312\The Fellowship shall teach ye, and show ye the guiding light... 
24313\It is by passing the tests of the Fellowship, that ye will grow
24314\stronger within its eyes... 
24315\And arise in the hopes of one day joining with the ranks of the
24316\High Fathers, the Lords of the House of Dane! 
24317\But be careful that ye dost not attempt to climb before ye hast
24318\gained in thy faith... 
24319\For the Fellowship is demanding, and ye may likely perish within
24320\its harsh and trying judgement... 
24321\May the guiding light protect ye in thy Trial of the Fellowship!
24325*\Greetings, fair brethren...
24326\May the guiding light protect ye!
24330*\Only a few shall pass the Trial of the Fellowship and arise within
24331\its ranks... 
24332\Beware the jealous lot of others who seek attainment... 
24333\For ye and they are all a part of the divine wisdom of the Trial
24334\of the Fellowship!
24340*\May the sacrament serve ye well!
24380*\Upon a runed block arising from the floor rests a tiny golden urn...
24385*\You sprinkle the silvery powder into the urn... 
24386\Soon, a trace wisp of smoke arises from it, fading into the air...

24405*\A spray of choking gas jets from the ceiling, engulfing everyone...
24410*\A strange purple haze bathes the party with light tingling
24411\particles...
24415*\A radiant bubble of light descends from within the adjoining chamber,
24416\encircling you for a moment, and then bursting over your heads...
24420*\Entering the antechamber, a gaseous swirling ether condenses to
24421\form a dark cloudy shape...
24425*\All who would accept the Trial of the Fellowship, must prove
24426\themselves worthy before the Spirit of Dane!
24430*\Inside the chest you find a miniature golden figurine, faceless, but
24431\no doubt cast in the form of the statuesque Danes...
24450*\Greetings, bretheren of the Fellowship...

24550*\A pile of parchments lie neatly stacked in the corner,
24551\covered with a fine cloth...

24559\!New City MOONTIMES
24560\@The poster is quite illustrative, and has a somewhat exciting allure
24561\about it...
24562\@For some reason you almost feel compelled to go there...
24563\@In fact, it's all you can think about...

24580*\#!Temple Of

24590*\A circle of entranced Dane sit quietly in the open chamber,
24591\meditating upon some distant thought, reaching to touch that place
24592\in the mind wherein resides the secret of inner power and
24593\knowing bliss...
24594\@Like statues they sit, unmoving, and it is only after a few
24595\minutes that you notice the figure standing at the rear of the
24596\room, watching you without watching...
24597\@Gracefully, as if gliding upon the floor, he moves toward you
24598\and speaks...
24600*\Only they that know ever journey into the realm that lies
24601\beyond... 
24602\It is the realm where the mind becomes the center of the universe,
24603\and all infinity unfolds before its eye... 
24604\Only looking, never touching... 
24605\It is the place of true essense, freed from all trappings and
24606\postulates of the outer world... 
24607\This is the inner kingdom, the land of peace and true knowledge...

24615*\So be it...

24621\In the lair of the beast... 
24622\And then return here... 
24623\If ye know, then ye will know what to do...
24625*\And the figure and all the other Danes fade away, one by one...
24630*\In the center of the floor a glowing key beckons you enticingly...
24640*\5600
24641\What do you do?
24642\MEDITATE ON WORD
24643\LEAVE THE AREA
24645*\The open chamber lies empty and tranquil, no sign of anyone
24646\to be found...
24650*\Sitting alone in the peaceful chamber, the word floats inside your
24651\head, hovering above just out of reach...
24660*\#!Lair Of
24661\!The Beast
24665*\Stepping into the Lair of the Beast, you are consumed by the darkness
24666\once again... 
24667\Soon you hear a distant sound, soft, slushy, and slurpy... 
24668\And then it alights before you, irridescent in the surrounding
24669\blackness...
24675*\As the fallen beast lies dying, you wonder if this was as intended...
24676\@Then, in its final expiring gasp, it seems to utter a peculiar
24677\syllable, almost inaudible...
24678\@It sounded like...
24679\!"MOO"...
24685*\In the darkness you stumble over something on the floor...
24686\@With a few tinks and clinks, it comes to a rest somewhere at your
24687\feet...
24690*\Carefully crawling around on your hands and knees, you find the
24691\small golden figurine which you had kicked a few moments ago...
24700*\#!Temple Of
24701\!Aerial Whimsey
24705*\Opening the chest, you gaze upon a sparkling stone, radiating hues
24706\of green and blue...
24710*\The surroundings are so dark that it's hard to breathe.
24711\You really start to lose your breath.
24712\Lights dance around your head, finally you can't breathe.
24720*\After a few moments you are breathing and open your eyes...
24722*\It is still dark, but there is a glowing object in the distance... 
24723\It is a sparkling globe of some kind, like a crystal ball... 
24724\You are unable to move, and you watch helplessly as it grows...
24726*\And then it begins to disappear... 
24727\Not vanishing, but descending into the floor...
24729*\And then you see a figure...
24731*\It is a young woman... 
24732\She is standing over the spot where the strange orb disappeared... 
24733\She seems to be doing something with her hands... 
24734\And then she too fades, and all is dark once more...
24736*\With a start, you open your eyes yet again... 
24737\And it is still dark... 
24738\But this time you are able to move...
24740*\#!Temple Of
24741\!Deadly Coffers
24745*\Lying in the bottom of the chest, wrapped inside a brown tallowed
24746\cloth, you uncover an ancient piece of parchment...
24750*\#!Temple Of
24751\!The Wanderers
24755*\The chest has been recently opened, and contains nothing but empty
24756\tallowed wrappings...
24757\@Whatever it was that was sealed inside, someone else has beaten you
24758\to it...
24760*\Inside the room, you feel a slight buzzing vibration
24761\which seems to permeate everything...
24762\@Lasting only a brief moment, it quickly ceases, without any apparent
24763\ill effect...

24772*\The fireballs explode as they strike, bursting
24773\upon the wall in a dazzling display of sparks and flame... 
24774\In the aftermath of the firestorm, you hear the cracking voice of
24775\a wailing madman exclaim, COME MY CHILDREN! 
24776\THY MASTER WISHES MORE OF THIS EXQUISITE DELIGHT! 
24777\Peering through the bars of the gate, you see a wild orgy of bodies...
24778\@They are as one, convulsing in abandoned ecstacy, preparing to
24779\unleash another round of sizzling infernos...
24785*\Trudging onward despite the flames, you advance as another flock of
24786\raging fire comes flying through the gate... &
24787\
24790*\HA HA HA!! 
24791\The voice of the madman shrieks with pleasure, and he calls to the
24792\mass of half naked bodies once more, 
24793\BURN THEM, BURN THEM, BURN THEM ALL!! 
24794\HA HA HA HA!!!
24800*\Another round of streaming fires come pouring through the gate! &
24801\
24805*\The oscillating voice of the insane Dane now screaming, he calls
24806\again, 
24807\MORE MORE MORE!!!
24810*\A huge gust of white hot fire blasts through the gate, consuming
24811\your blackened bodies in a blinding explosion! 
24815*\From the orgy of Danes you hear the cry, 
24816\AFTER THEM CHILDREN, LET THEM NOT ESCAPE!!
24818*\Before you stands a solid chrome gate, silver, bright and strong...
24820*\Hurling yourselves into the chamber, you face a well prepared band
24821\of demonic red eyed Danes...
24825*\In the chest you discover and old and dusty book, bound within a cover
24826\of blackened cracked leather, and upon it writ in bloody letters,
24827\@THE BOOK OF IMMORTALS
24830*\Upon the gate is a gruesome head, cast in black iron, appearing like
24831\some hideous creature of the netherworld...
24832\@Atop the forehead of the demonic face is a round opening, as if
24833\perhaps to berth a thick candle...
24834\@Through the bars of the gate you spy a distant chest, sealed and
24835\sparkling, revealing no clue as to its mysterious contents...
24840*\Inserting the Demon Cornu within the black iron head, you stand back,
24841\swords and spells ready...
24845*\But nothing happens...
24850*\#!Temple Of
24851\!The Magna Dane
24860*\Your eyes bulge at the decadent obscene pulse of bodies that are
24861\strewn about the chamber, ripe with wine and orgasm...
24862\@And standing in their midst, chanting and foaming, you gaze upon
24863\what must surely be the spawn of the devil himself, the Magna Dane!
24870*\YE HAVE RISEN HIGH IN THE HOUSE OF DANE! 
24871\THOUGH YE CLAIM THE TITLE LORDS OF DANE, YE ARE NOT TRUE DANE...

24921\WHENCE UPON MY THRONE SHALL YE SIT!
24930*\#!Pit Of The
24931\!Demon Spawn
24935*\The pit is dark and sooty, as if great fires had blazed from its
24936\depths...
24940*\Into the pit you throw the jar of the innards of Munk, the blood of
24941\the enemies of Dane...
24945*\Into the pit you sprinkle the Ashes of Diam, and watch as emerges
24946\a billowing cloud of smoke...
24950*\Into the pit you hurl the mystical Stone of Gates, igniting the smoke
24951\to a stream of white hot fire...
24955*\Up from the scorching pyre ascends the raging Hellspawn... 
24956\His fists ablaze with globes of searing white flame... 
24957\And upon his head thrusting the great devil's cornu... 
24958\ONCE AGAIN I AM SUMMONED TO THE WORLD OF MAN, 
24959\TRAPPED BY THE PIT OF THE SPAWNING WELL; 
24960\COME THEN, YE MORTALS, FACE THE SPAWN OF THE DAMNED... 
24961\YE WHOSE SOULS SHALL I TAKE BACK TO HELL!!
24965*\In the final stroke of the battle was the great demon cornu severed
24966\from the head of the beast, falling back into the depths of the pit
24967\as the spawn of hell burst into pyre of black flame...
24970*\From outside the gates of the Pit you hear the cry...
24971\@"QUICKLY MY CHILDREN, TAKE THE HORN!
24980*\TO THE DEATH YE OF DANE, BRING ME THE HORN!! 
24981\And the children, slaves, whores, and fathers of Torquesade, the
24982\insane Lord of all Dane, the Magna Dane, attack as if driven by
24983\the tumultuous fury of all hells...
24990*\Walking among the mass of obliterated bodies, you come across the
24991\twisted corpse of the fallen Torquesade, the Magna Dane...
24992\@You pause...
24993\@And with a slight nod, wonder silently...
24994\@What now shall become...
24995\@Of the mighty House of Dane...
25000*\Suddenly you detect a slight shimmer, the glint of a metal ring
25001\upon the finger of the deposed and headless caesar...
25005*\In the charred and blackened Pit of the Hellspawn, you spy
25006\the great devil's smouldering cornu!
25010*\From above, you hear the hysterical voice of Torquesade, the Magna
25011\Dane...
25012\@"KILL THEM, SEIZE THEM, BRING ME THE HORN!!!
25013\@It does not sound as if the Magna Dane will be keeping any bargains...
25014\@In fact, he sounds rather rabid and out of control...
25020*\Approaching the gateway, a sudden bustle of the maddening crowd
25021\at your back tells you that you have blundered into a trap...
25030*\You raise the Magna Dane's ring before the gate...
25035*\Lying upon a jeweled cushion of fine silk, a coiled serpent twined upon
25036\a radiant sceptre shines with an aura of polished gold...
25040*\Descending into the Pit, you see that its walls are thick with
25041\a black residue, as if the spit of a blistering inferno...
25042\@It is then that you recognize the ashen lumps and shoots upon the
25043\ground...
25044\@The remnants of incinerated bones...
25050*\High atop the Great Tower of Dane, howling winds blow and blackness
25051\swallows the sky like a cloak of perteptual night...
25090*\Embedded into the wall is a circular golden emblem, a ring
25091\of wavy spines around a core of grasping prongs...
25100*\Surprisingly, you pass through the stone wall as if it were not
25101\there...
25105*\You insert the glistening jewel into the prongs at the center
25106\of the golden emblem... 
25107\But nothing happens...
25110*\Passing through the illusionary wall, you
25111\feel a slight tingle throughout your body...
25115*\As the tingling subsides, you notice a lingering disorientation...
25120*\Stepping from the stone cubicle, you realize that it is some kind
25121\of gateway, but leading to where you know not...
25122\@Ahead stands a familiar statue, stern and somber in the quiet of
25123\the mysterious courtyard...
25125*\Standing at the statue, it appears more at ease than before...
25126\@The stone looks fresh, as if it were carved only yesterday,
25127\although a thick layer of rust around its base suggests
25128\it has been here a long time...
25129\@Gazing up into the face of the majestic figure, you detect
25130\a faint smile and its eyes seem to almost twinkle...
25135*\Scraping off the thick rust, you unearth a metal plate at
25136\the foot of the statue engraved as follows:
25137\@#!T H E
25138\!P R O P H E T
25140*\While cleaning the plate you discover that
25141\the second "P" in the engraving pivots at the top...
25142\@Beneath it you find a glowing sapphire locket, apparently placed
25143\here a long time ago...
25150*\Removing the locket from its ancient cache, you jump with surprise
25151\as a voice speaks from the statue's mouth...
25160*\WELCOME MY LOST CHILDREN... 
25161\THE DAY IS COME! 
25162\I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY CENTURIES HAVE PASSED SINCE LAST I BREATHED
25163\THESE AIRS AND WALKED THESE LANDS... 
25164\BUT IN DEATH DOES TIME LOSE ALL MEANING... 
25165\AND SO IT IS BUT A MOMENT AGO THAT I LAY DOWN TO FINAL REST... 
25166\THERE IS MUCH I WISH TO TELL YOU, THE STORY OF ALL STORIES... 
25167\OF LIFE AND DEATH, AND OF THE TIME BETWEEN... 
25168\BUT SOON ENOUGH SHALL MY VOICE FADE AGAIN, ITS ENERGY DEPLETED, ITS
25169\TASK AT END... 
25170\IN YOUR HANDS YOU HOLD THE LOCKET, A PART OF THE FINAL KEY... 
25171\CARRY IT WELL, FOR IT IS A GUARDIAN OF MY SECRET... 
25172\WITHIN ITS CRYSTAL CELLS HAVE I IMPRINTED THE CODE OF MY PALM... 
25173\SO THAT BY MY HAND ALONE SHALL THE KEY UNLOCK THE ASTRAL TOMB... 
25174\BUT THOUGH I BE DEAD A THOUSAND MILLENIA, THIS CAST DOES YET LIVE
25175\ON... 
25176\FOR UPON ALL MY DESCENDANTS AND THEIRS, FOR THE REMAINDER OF ALL TIME,
25177\SHALL MY CODE EXIST UPON THEIR HANDS, THE SECRET BEQUEATHED THROUGH
25178\THE BLOOD OF MY CHILDREN... 
25179\I DO NOT KNOW YOUR NAME, WHETHER YOU BE MAN OR WOMAN OR CHILD... 
25180\BUT IF YOUR BLOOD BE MINE, THEN THE SECRET SHALL BE THINE... 
25181\WHEN YOU STAND ALONE WITHIN THE ASTRAL TOMB, GRASP THE
25182\LOCKET WITHIN YOUR PALMS... 
25183\AND BEHOLD THE MIRACLE! 
25184\O, WOULD THAT I COULD SEE THE WONDERS OF MY WORKS! 
25185\MY BLESSINGS BE UPON YOU, DISTANT CHILD OF MY LOINS... 
25186\UPON YOUR BROW DO I HEAVE THE WEIGHT OF A UNIVERSE! 
25187\...Then the statue becomes silent and still, the twinkle fading from
25188\its eyes...
25190*\Inside the magic cubicle, you behold a sparkling jewel mounted
25191\within a familiar golden emblem...
25200*\Ahead lies a dense white fog, and through it can be heard the sounds
25201\of the sea crashing against the shore...
25202\@Or possibly just a rocky reef...
25210*\The ship glances off a shallow reef, heaving everyone to the deck!
25215*\The sea butts up against the barren cliffs of the Dragon Mountains,
25216\a treacherous cove with no safe harbour...
25220*\In the darkness you can see the light of a distant lantern, but
25221\whether to warn sailors of deadly reefs or to lure them in upon
25222\them you cannot tell...
25225*\Near the shining light you see that it isn't a lantern at all, but
25226\a hunk of glowing phosphor embedded into the face of the cliff...
25227\@Invisible by day, the phosphor radiates brightly in the dark of the
25228\midnight sky...
25230*\Taking the Serpentine Staff and holding it high in front of the
25231\glowing rock, you discover that the phosphor chunk is not here by act
25232\of nature, but by design...
25235*\The side of the cliff retracts and opens the pass to an underground
25236\cove...
25238*\After waving the Serpentine Staff for awhile, you feel a bit silly...
25240*\In the murky waters ahead you hear a faint eerie cry...
25245*\Drawing nearer, you discern the figure of a woman
25246\bathing in the cove...
25250*\=P3,Softly she sings her haunting chant, against the sound of the rushing
25251\waves...
25255*\Enticing and beautiful, no one notices you drifting in until...
25260*\BROMBADEG HAS RISEN!
25265*\In the blood filled waters the leviathan carcass slips back to the
25266\depths, a gruesome end to the monsterous legend...
25267\@There'll be no trophy to adorn any marina's walls, and perhaps this
25268\too is how it should be...
25269\@After all, real myths are hard to come by...
25280*\Deep in the dragon's lair you discover the bones of an
25281\ill fated venture, a grisly skeleton crew...
25282\@Spying the great chest at the rear of the cavern, you wonder if
25283\this could have been a band of pirates, burying their treasure,
25284\little suspecting that their secret hideaway was already occupied
25285\by a fire breathing tenant...
25286\@You consider momentarily the tales of dying pirates who curse
25287\their booty with a last gasping breath...
25288\@But then think better, as such stories are usually the kinds of tales
25289\meant for children and midnight campfires...
25290\@These bones look harmless enough...
25291\@Just to be sure, however, you take a casual stroll around the cavern
25292\stepping on any pirate skulls that happen to be
25293\lying about, crushing them beneath the
25294\grating heel of your boot...
25295\@There, that should take care of any old pirate's curse...
25300*\Though the stories of a dragon's fancy for treasure are legend, you
25301\discover there is apparent truth in the tale...
25302\@Weighty chests appear to litter the cavern, all hoarded
25303\together for you by some tightwaded hot breath lizard...
25305*\Oh oh... 
25306\Looks like the tightwad has come home!
25310*\What a curious thing to find here...
25315*\!CAVE-IN!!!
25350*\Emerging from the dark caves, you are shocked to discover an entire
25351\city built upon the mountain plateau...
25352\@But it is no ordinary city...
25353\@Like a palace made from sparkling jewels, there is an enigmatic
25354\glimmer which mirrors the light as if reflecting from a thousand
25355\suns...
25356\@And in the air, scarlet angels zip to and fro upon chariots of steel
25357\and fire...
25358\@At your feet lies a glistening plaque...
25359\@#!The
25360\!CITY Of SKY
25370*\Approaching the odd construction of floating sky, it finally becomes
25371\apparent that the structure is composed of a thick resilient
25372\transparent material, like glass though flexible and supple,
25373\and yet tough as steel...
25380*\Peering from outside a glass encased alcove, you see a luminescent
25381\object floating above a small dais...
25390*\050600
25391*\Entering the gazebo, you view a radiant key...
25392\TOUCH THE KEY
25393\TAKE THE KEY
25394\LEAVE THE KEY
25400*\Cautiously you touch the key...
25401\@It feels soft and fuzzy, but it is not hot and does not hurt...
25405*\Carefully you take hold of the luminescent key, and are relieved
25406\to find that your hand did not fall off...
25410*\#!STORAGE
25411\!FACILITY
25415*\The storage facility appears vacant...

25900*\Upon the flat stretch of pavement lying just ahead, you view

25902\@It is old, and a bit faded, but there is no mistaking that it is

25985*\Examining the main console bank, you notice an odd indenture,
25986\positioned to the left of the controls... 
25987\The indenture appears made to hold an object of some kind...
25990*\While examining the controls, you discover an inconspicuous
25991\button... 
25992\Pressing the button, a compartment opens up underneath the dash,
25993\within which lies a crested sapphire ring...

26000*\Placing the locket within the indenture, it makes a perfect fit... 
26001\Unfortunately, nothing seems to be happening...
26005*\Exiting the ship, you are relieved to have discovered a potential
26006\means of exodus from this world, though there is some concern
26007\about your inability to fully comprehend its operation... 
26008\Hopefully, sooner or later you will stumble upon its secret...
26100*\=E14.0,On the inner wall of the stone pillars, hewn in the rock,
26101\you gaze upon the intricate carving of a most unusual creature...
26102\@It looks a little like a woman...
26103\@And a little like a cat...
26104\@With a tad of lizard thrown in...
26105\@Surrounded by feathery plummage resembling that of a peacock...
26106\@The carving is very elaborate, and every detail of the creature
26107\seems so life like that it is almost as if the creature itself
26108\=E99.0,had become trapped within the stone...
26110*\=E14.11,You wave the mystical wand before the magnificent stone carving...
26111\@It is without dissapointment that you watch as the wand begins
26112\to crackle and fume, a torch of golden sparks, glossing the image
26113\whittled in the rock...
26114\@Slowly, the features in the stone take on color, and
26115\portions of the carving begin to writhe and wriggle...
26116\@Soon, the limbs of the beast begin extracting themselves from
26117\the wall...
26118\@Whether the strange creature had become trapped within the rock,
26119\or whether the magical wand brought life to the stone, or whether
26120\all of this is merely a fantastic illusion of some kind, matters
26121\little, as the beast now fully realized emerges from the wall...
26130*\You've had long to consider my puzzle... 
26131\But before I may let you herein... 
26132\You must answer me this, your reply... 
26133\When I ask of you, 'What is the question?'
26135*\MAN/WOMAN/
26136\
26137\What do you reply?
26140*\Close enough! 
26141\Indeed, What is a Man, What is a Man, What is a Man! 
26142\A most perplexing riddle, I would say... 
26143\That is, if I were a man, which I am not... 
26144\But then, how very odd for you! 
26145\I suppose it's a most annoying poser... 
26146\Annoying if you think about it, that is... 
26147\Which is to say that if you don't, then I suppose it doesn't
26148\much matter... 
26149\But since I have a fondness for such riddles... 
26150\Perhaps I could find another for you... 
26151\Ah! I believe I have the perfect one... 
26152\How about... 
26153\'What am I?' 
26154\...And with that strange utterance the unusual creature leaps into the
26155\air above your head...
26165*\Posh! 
26166\You haven't really thought about it at all! 
26167\Though I suppose I could give you another try... 
26168\But then, from the look on your faces, I'm not sure it will
26169\prove more rewarding than the first... 
26170\Well, let's try again anyway...
26175*\Dear me, it would seem that you're not the quizzical kind... 
26176\Very well then, I'll tell you... 
26177\The question, dear sirs or madams... 
26178\The question is, 'What is a Man?' 
26179\O hell, there I go again... Spoiling everything... 
26180\Giving away the answer, that is, the question...
26190*\You watch as the extraordinary beast sails away into the sky, soon
26191\becoming a tiny dot, until at last disappearing...
26192\@The remaining wall before you starts to crumble...
26195*\A rather ghoulish stench bellows up from the pit below, and a
26196\disturbing chill seems to waft through the air...
26200*\Cast upon the framework of the gate, a serpentine dragon
26201\of black iron weaves up and through the lattice, its head
26202\perched out from the top of the gate in a ferocious snarling
26203\display of teeth and tongue...
26205*\The apparition was as ugly a ghoulish hag as the gods could have
26206\possibly contrived to invent, and you wonder what torturous
26207\grotesqueness might have inspired them...
26208\@Tragic enough to go through life with such a hideous countenance,
26209\but to suffer so through death as well seems to exceed the bounds of
26210\of cruelty and dementation...
26211\@Not to mention the fact that you couldn't understand what she was
26212\saying...
26213\@Something like 'MOSSY KNOB?'...
26214\@What in the world is a 'MOSSY KNOB?!?'
26216*\WWWWHERE ISSS MMMMY BMOCYENOBBBB? 
26217\IIIII WWWWANT MMMY BMOCYENOBBB!!
26220*\Inside the sepulcher rests the withered corpse of a royal Gorn...
26221\@A Queen you'd guess, judging from the shape of her form and the
26222\illustrious brocade of her burial raiments...
26223\@Looking at her mummified face, however, you begin to wretch and
26224\soon turn away...
26225\@She's ugly, even for a Gorn...
26226\@By the gods, she's ugly even for a dead Gorn...
26227\@In fact, she's so ugly that pretty soon you have to start laughing
26228\to keep from throwing up...
26230*\Taking out the combs and brushes that you removed from the Castle
26231\of the Gorn King, you place them into the shriveled hands of the
26232\mummified queen thing...
26233\@Then, something strange occurs...
26234\@The shape of the mummy begins to alter, her face begins to change...
26235\@And before your eyes she is transformed...
26236\@Her face smooths, and the warts and blemishes fade...
26237\@Revealing the beautiful visage akin to that of a goddess...
26238\@She is still quite dead...
26239\@And she is still a mummy...
26240\@But whatever kind of curse she was under, the spell has been
26241\broken...
26242\@A gentle smile now gracing her lips, you silently whisper to no one:
26243\@Rest in peace, old girl, rest in peace...
26245*\Suddenly you become racked with pain, as if a diabolical beast were
26246\tearing through your body...
26250*\I AM EVILSPEAK!
26251\@You quickly turn to see who among you spoke, but everyone appears
26252\equally puzzled by the mysterious haunting voice...
26253\@That such things are here is not a good sign...
26255*\I AM EVILSPEAK!
26260*\From out of nowhere a blinding ball of flame envelops the party...
26265*\A shimmering light bleeds from the atmosphere surrounding you,
26266\bathing you within a soft crimson light...
26270*\Inside the sepulture rest the decayed and disintegrated bones of
26271\an unrecognizable corpse...
26275*\Inside the sepulture rest the withered remains of a Gorn nobleman,
26276\identifiable from the short tusks which are protruding at bizarre
26277\angles from out of his macerated mouth...
26280*\3900
26281\Do you search the mummy?
26282\UNWRAP THE MUMMY
26283\LEAVE THE MUMMY
26285*\Inside the sepulture rests the figure of an enshrouded mummy...
26286\@A dark aura seems to be surrounding the wrapped body, and it
26287\possesses a sinister poise...
26290*\In spite of the evil omens which accompany the corpse, you begin
26291\unwrapping the bandages...
26292\@The body is dry and brittle, and you can feel it crumbling
26293\under the wrappings as you attempt to unravel it...
26294\@Whilst unwinding the head it crumples, spilling out, and
26295\a plop of teeth, eyes and bone dust splash to the floor...
26296\@Clutched in one of the decimated hands, however, you feel an
26297\an object hard and strong...
26298\@Metal...
26299\@Gold to be exact, as you extract a shining ankh from the
26300\pulverized mitt...
26310*\Everyone starts feeling kind of dizzy...
26311\@And sick...
26312\@The poison was very slow to take effect...
26313\@But you recognize the symptoms all to well...
26320*\Inside the sepulture rests a small golden urn, empty...
26325*\You sprinkle the magic Jonga powder into the golden urn, and watch
26326\as a trace wiff of smoke soon arises...
26330*\#!HALL OF

26335*\On the face of the stone pillar are carved many symbols and runes
26336\in a style both ornate and cryptic...

26380*\You hold the Gaelin Legend over the face of the Runed Tablet, but none
26381\of the holes seem to align properly...
26385*\You hold the Gaelin Legend over the face of the Runed Tablet, and
26386\see that the holes in the parchment conform perfectly with knobs of
26387\stone protruding from the pillar...
26388\@The hole near the center of the Legend is positioned directly over
26389\the eye of the Dragon, and by inserting your finger, you discover that
26390\it is actually a well concealed button...
26391\@Pushing the button, a secret compartment opens up in the Tablet,
26392\revealing a black key in the shape of a skull...

27482\electric blue arcs sparking across one hand and a white sword
27483\whisking in the other...
27485*\=E1.0,Not very subtle in your attempts at espionage are you... 
27486\I was monitoring the system when you accessed the files... 
27487\You shouldn't be in here... 
27488\But then... 
27489\Neither should I! Ha ha ha... 
27490\I have come from the Black Ship, the ship of the Dark Savant! 
27491\He's gone completely mad, calling himself a
27492\divine lord of the universe or something... 
27493\He keeps talking about destiny and strange prophecies... 
27494\And about an all powerful globe that will transform him
27495\into a kind of god... 
27496\The As-Trel Dah-Me-Nay... 
27497\He said that he needed me to help him find it... 
27498\That I'm supposed to know something about it... 
27499\At first, it seemed like a chance for real adventure... 
27500\Cruise the galaxy in style, you know... 
27501\But he's become more and more obsessed lately...

27521\...Immediately the young whip like girl jumps
27522\into action, unleashing a powerful bolt of energy at the titanic
27523\figure from her glowing hand of blue white metal... 
27524\In a dazzling display of fireworks, the Dark Savant returns a blast
27525\likewise from his outstretched arm, hurling a blistering arc of
27526\thunder into her shuddering body... 
27527\As she slumps to the floor, you notice a flurry of sparks and
27528\smoke emerging from around his helmet, and he instantly starts
27529\clutching at his throat... 
27530\With a strength surpassing anything human, he hefts up her collapsed
27531\form in one hand and heaves her into the back chamber, the door of
27532\=F114, which slams shut as he chokingly vanishes inside a shimmer of blue...

27551\a handful of feathers, a red light blinks on and off...
27555*\Peering in through the window, you can see the fallen body of the
27556\one eyed warrior woman crumpled in the corner...
27557\@You cannot tell whether she is dead or alive...
27558\@And if alive, how much longer she will remain so...
27600*\The Security System apparently disabled, you enter the room with the
27601\unconscious girl...
27602\@After a few minutes, she groans and awakens...
27610*\Uunnnnghhh! 
27611\My head! 
27612\What happened? 
27613\Oh, I remember... 
27614\He'll be coming back for me... 
27615\He can't get his precious orb without me... 
27616\I need a ship! 
27617\And now that he's seen us together, he'll be looking for you as
27618\well... 
27619\Our only chance is to find the Astral doo dad before he does... 
27620\And try to make some kind of deal... 
27621\Assuming he's not totally insane by now... 
27622\I heard him say that it was located beneath a
27623\morgue on a small island somewhere... 
27624\Here, take this...
27630*\It's a small transmitter, so I can keep track of you... 
27631\If you can find the stellar globe then perhaps we can
27632\kiss this chunk of asteroid goodbye... 
27633\I should go back to the ship and try to soften him up... 
27634\I'll tell him I was attempting to stop some thieves, and he
27635\misunderstood ... 
27636\In the meantime, see what you can discover... 
27637\And if you locate the As-Trel Da-Men-Ah... 
27638\Press the button on the transmitter... 
27639\It will signal me and I'll beam down to join you... 
27640\And see if you can get us a ride on another spaceship
27641\somewhere... 
27642\But don't trust the tarantula heads... 
27643\They'd sell us out for sure! 
27644\By the way, my name is Vitalia... 
27645\But everyone calls me Vi... 
27646\Vi Domina...
27655*\You watched transfixed as the electric girl touched her wrist and
27656\shimmered away into nothingness...
27657\@It will take some time before among your discussions you are able
27658\to piece together exactly what the young girl was talking about,
27659\but the essense of her meaning was clear...
27660\@The Dark Savant is a dangerous threat,
27661\and time seems to be running out...
27662\@She mentioned an island somewhere, and a morgue...
27663\@And at the bottom, perhaps the fabled sphere of power...
27664\@Of immediate concern, however, is getting out of here before the
27665\armored juggernaut can return...
27670*\The gate to the fabled tomb open, you almost hesitate to enter...
27675*\Taking a glance across the room, you are disappointed to find the
27676\entire chamber looking quite empty...
27677\@Perhaps you are too late and someone has beaten you to the prize...
27680*\Searching carefully along the floor, you detect a faint hairline
27681\crack which traces the outline of a trap door...
27682\@But how to open it, that is the question...
27685*\Moving to the center of the chamber, you take the blinking device
27686\which the electric warrior girl gave to you and push the button... 
27687\You wait...
27690*\=P3,=F101,A luminous glow of colorful light bathes the room, and within it

27721\what you might have missed...

27745*\NO/YES/
27746\
27747\Maybe I should try, what do you say?
27750*\=F103,...You hand the mysterious blue locket and the odd ring from
27751\Phoonzang's spaceship to Vi Domina... 
27752\Examining the sapphire locket, she cups it into the palms
27753\of her hands... 
27754\Suddenly, it starts to glow!
27760*\=F104,Up from the center of the floor arises a dark globe seated upon
27761\=L35,=S0.0,a magnificent pedestal... 
27762\Hey! 
27763\It worked!! 
27764\But it looks kind of lifeless to me... 
27765\If this is some sort of super dome, I think it's lost it's fizz... 
27766\...And while she is looking it over, a gossamer light appears behind
27767\her in the room... 
27780*\=F105,DID YOU THINK YOU COULD FOOL ME?!! 
27781\=F106,I HAD YOU INJECTED WITH A HOMING DEVICE AFTER
27782\YOUR LAST ESCAPADE, MY DEAR VITALIA! 
27783\AND SOMETHING EXTRA ALONG WITH IT!! 
27784\...Before anyone can react, the Dark Savant presses a button
27785\upon his forearm and Vi Domina freezes, her eye turning white in the
27786\back of her head, her body shaking as if being subjected to an
27787\invisible current of paralyzing pain...
27800*\AND NOW MY FRIENDS, SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN GOOD ENOUGH TO LEAD ME TO
27801\THE LEGENDARY TOMB OF THE ASTRAL DOMINAE, I WILL DEAL WITH YOU
27802\QUICKLY AND MOST MERCIFULLY!! 
27803\BUT FIRST, THE GLOBE!!
27805*\=F107, ...Flinging himself upon the dark crystal ball, he grasps and tears
27806\=F8, at it, but it does not budge or move... 
27807\WHAT'S THIS! 
27808\WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! 
27809\IT WON'T COME OFF!!! &
27810\ARRRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!! 
27811\NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL TO DIE!!
27820*\The epic battle over, you stare as his remains shimmer away...
27821\@You wonder what secrets he held, and regret the loss of such
27822\potential booty as his corpse might have contained...
27823\@Not to mention his knowledge of the Astral Dominae...
27824\@Too late for remorse now, however, and you turn your attention
27825\back to Vi, who seems to have been released from the grip of
27826\searing pain that had crippled her...
27830*\Uunngowwahh! 
27831\Remind me never to go through that again!! 
27832\I think you killed him... 
27833\Too bad... 
27834\If not for his insane obsession with the Astro Ball, I think
27835\perhaps he might not have been such a sister of bad news... 
27836\Farewell, o mysterious traveller, ye Dark Savant!! 
27837\Now what do we do with the Globe? 
27838\Perhaps the ring somehow... 
27839\...She approches the black orb and places the ring upon her
27840\finger... 
27850*\Behold, The Astral Dominae! 
27851\Very pretty, but what's it for? 
27852\It looks like a fancy ornament to me... 
27853\...Everyone crowds around and peers into the glittering orb... 
27854\Swirling colors, bright luminescent images, dancing around inside
27855\the astral globe... 
27856\All apparently meaningless... 
27857\Then suddenly, Vi becomes quiet and still,
27858\as if something strange was passing through her... 
27859\As if in a deep trance, she does something most unusual... 
27860\Squatting before the Astral Globe, she pulls up the patch covering
27861\her eye... 
27862\And inside the deep socket of her head, you gaze upon an
27863\irridescent pupil less eye, an undulating veinous orb, hideous upon
27864\her otherwise beautiful countenance... 
27865\Wow! 
27866\...She seems to be lost, staring into the holographic crystal
27867\ball... 
27868\This is incredible... 
27869\It's a blueprint... 
27870\No, it's... 
27871\It's a formula, a code... 
27872\For the creation of Life! 
27873\Wait... 
27874\It's also a map... 
27875\Of Energy... 
27876\And Matter... 
27877\Of the nexus between Energy and Matter! 
27878\But, but... 
27879\Then, that is what Life is... 
27880\The nexus, the flux, the bridge between Matter and Energy...
27881\That is the secret of Life! 
27882\By the gods!!! 
27883\With the power of this Globe, you could create a living being of
27884\unlimited energy! 
27885\A being with the power of the stars! 
27886\A Superman!! 
27887\A God!!! 
27888\No wonder the Dark Savant wanted to get his hands on this... 
27889\Ut! 
27890\What's this... 
27891\It's a chart of a star system... 
27892\Hey! I recognize this system... 
27893\But there isn't a... 
27894\Oh! 
27895\Very clever! 
27896\This must be where it all started! 
27897\C'mon, we've got to get moving!! 
27898\...Then breaking away, she removes the ring and inserts it into a
27899\small niche at the base of the globe...
27910*\Springing the Astral Dominae free from its perch, she hands the
27911\darkening crystal ball back to you...
27920*\Keep this safe until we can get away from here... 
27921\Waaay out of here!! 
27922\...Though you understood only bits and pieces of what the hysterical
27923\girl was trying to tell you as she ooo'd and ahh'd at the sights
27924\within the starry sphere,
27925\you understood well enough what it would mean for someone
27926\with the power to create super monsters and super men, and worse,
27927\super gods... 
27928\Who among you could have guessed that on this day would the awesome
27929\power of the heavens fall into your hands... 
27930\But before you have time to ponder the blasphemous, unholy, incredible
27931\and cosmic significances of everything that has unfolded, the
27932\lively spacegirl with whom your destiny seems inextricably
27933\intertwined continues... 
27934\We need a ship!!
27955*\NO/YES/
27956\
27957\Did you find a spacecraft?
27960*\=923,I have an idea... 
27961\With the Dark Savant gone, I might be able to sneak back aboard
27962\the Dedaelis and steal a shuttlecraft... 
27963\It's risky, but since there are a few things I need from the
27964\Black Ship, I should try... 
27965\I would bring you with me, but the transponder on my glove isn't
27966\powerful enough to beam us all together... 
27967\And the Savant Androids are accustomed to seeing me on the ship,
27968\but you'd be a dead giveaway... 
27969\Return to the Operations Station where we first met... 
27970\Once I receive your signal, I'll steal the shuttle and come pick you
27971\up... 
27972\Wish me luck! 
27973\And don't lose the Globe!!
27980*\Still unaccustomed to the magic which she seems to wield, you
27981\stand in awe and wonder as she shimmers away, knowing that she
27982\goes to face a swarm of mad buzzing Savant Kui'Sa-Ka all alone...
27983\@For now, you have to deal with the problem of leaving the Tomb
27984\with the Astral Dominae...
27985\@Too bad you don't have one of those 'Tam Pondies' in your glove...
27990*\Xama Tama! 
27991\There are a few things I need to pick up from the Dedaelis, the
27992\Black Ship, before we leave... 
27993\With the Dark Savant gone, I might be able to sneak aboard without
27994\arousing too much suspicion... 
27995\I would bring you with me, but the transponder on my glove isn't
27996\powerful enough to beam us all together... 
27997\And the Savant Androids are accustomed to seeing me on the ship,
27998\but you'd be a dead giveaway... 
27999\Get to the spaceship as soon as possible... 
28000\Signal me once you're there, and I'll beam down to join you... 
28001\Better be prepared to leave in a hurry! 
28002\Good luck! 
28003\And don't lose the Globe!!
28100*\=P1,At last reaching the tarnished craft secreted here by Phoonzang those
28101\many millennia ago, you are ready to signal your ally, Vitalia
28102\Domina, and depart this most peculiar world... 
28103\You reflect a few moments upon the many adventures that were here
28104\for you, and upon the weight of all that has transpired... 
28105\What shall you do with the incredible secret discovered within the
28106\globe of Phoonzang, the Astral Dominae... 
28107\What is this new place that Vi Domina seems intent upon reaching in
28108\such a hurry... 
28109\And more, will the charms that seem to bless her life be strong
28110\enough to protect you as well... 
28111\Or will her impulsiveness eventually result in your own hoary
28112\demise... 
28113\All of these questions nag at the back of your mind as you stare
28114\at the spacecraft and the sky above, wondering what strange new
28115\realms may yet await... 
28116\With a simple sigh, you resign yourself to the notion that only
28117\the future will reveal the answers to these many questions and
28118\the thousand others that you feel pressing upon your shoulders... 
28119\Finally, you decide to summon your new partner...
28130*\=L35, =S0.0,Using the small device that Vi gave to you, you push the button... 
28131\In a few moments you see the familiar shimmer in the air, and
28132\giggle slightly at the funny tinkling sound that always seems
28133\to accompany the glittering event... 
28134\Something is wrong...
28140*\=I83,=F133, =I84,=F116,I BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOMETHING I WANT! 
28141\...You recognize instantly the chilling voice that sends shivers
28142\down your backs...
28145*\The Dark Savant has returned!!
28150*\Your eyes bulge at the horrible sight before you, a battered and
28151\bloody Vi Domina held in the clutches of the dread Savant... 
28152\Her skin and face torn, thrust upon her knees, her thin neck
28153\precariously in the grip of the powerful metal fingers that stem
28154\from the Dark Savant's electro pneumatic glove...
28160*\YOU HAVE BEEN MY PAWNS ALL ALONG... 
28161\I KNEW THAT THE GIRL WOULD NEVER DELIVER TO ME THE SECRET OF
28162\THE GLOBE, THE ASTRAL DOMINAE... 
28163\AND YOU HAVE SERVED MY PURPOSES ADMIRABLY... 
28164\DID YOU THINK YOU COULD VANQUISH ONE SUCH AS I SO EASILY? 
28165\I, THE NEW LORD AND MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE?! 
28166\I AM THE SAVANT, THE DARK HERALD OF CHANGE! 
28167\FOR TOO LONG HAS THE FATE OF MAN BEEN RULED BY THE GHOSTS
28168\OF THOSE ENSHROUDED IN MYSTERY... 
28169\DECIDING HOW AND WHEN MEN MIGHT
28170\BE SLOWLY FED THE SECRETS OF THE HEAVENS... 
28171\IT IS TIME FOR A NEW ORDER IN THE UNIVERSE! 
28172\IT IS THE TIME OF A NEW PERCEPTION OF PURPOSE IN THE COSMOS... 
28173\IT IS THE TIME OF THE COMING OF CHANGE! 
28174\I AM THE HARBINGER OF NEW DESTINY! 
28175\I WILL CREATE GALAXIES FILLED WITH SUPRAMEN... 
28176\MEN WHO ARE NOT AFRAID TO CHALLENGE THE OLD GODS... 
28177\MEN WHO ARE UNAFRAID TO EMBRACE THE TRUTH OF THE HEAVENS... 
28178\THIS FRAIL GIRL NEED NOT DIE... 
28179\HER WOUNDS WILL HEAL AND YOU MAY DEPART... 
28180\BUT I SHALL HAVE THE ASTRAL DOMINAE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER! 
28181\THE GLOBE FOR THE GIRL!! 
28182\...There is no description for the utter shock that is rippling
28183\through your mind at this moment, but the stark immediacy of the
28184\situation is apparent... 
28185\You must deliver the Astral Globe to the Dark Savant, or face
28186\the dire consequences that will surely follow... 
28187\And considering the unknown nature of his awesome powers, perhaps
28188\your role at this time is that of compliance... 
28189\After all, certain death is not the way of the wise... 
28190\And to die here shall certainly serve no meaningful purpose... 
28191\And who knows what tomorrow shall bring... 
28192\Better to be alive to see it, than not...
28210*\
GLOBE/GIRL/
28211\
28212\Will you keep the GLOBE or trade it for the GIRL?
28220*\=I83,=F134, =I84,=F117, You see the Dark Savant nod slightly and raise his hand, and then...
28230*\There is darkness all around, and you feel nothing, nothing at all...
28231\@You do not know how long you have been here...
28232\@You do not know how long you will remain...
28233\@There is only the darkness all around...
28240*\=I83,=F135, =I84,=F118, Most reluctantly and with trembling hand, you hold out the Astral
28241\Dominae for the Dark Savant to take...
28245*\THE PRIZE IS MINE! AHH HA HA HA HA HA!!
28250*\=I83,=F138, =I84,=F120, And then he and the globe are gone...
28260*\The figure of the girl lies slumped upon the ground... 
28261\Racing to her, you pick up her shivering body, your eyes straining for
28262\=I83,=F136, =I84,=F121, any signs that the spark of life may yet remain inside her... 
28263\And then, a glint of recognition... 
28264\She is weak and torn, but she is alive... 
28265\It is then that you remember the last secret of the globe... 
28266\The secret that Phoonzang divined to keep his work safe from the
28267\hands of those who would bode ill for the fate of the universe... 
28268\And you quake as you notice the trickle of blood which drools down
28269\upon her right cheek... 
28270\With a shaking hand you pull back the black patch which covers her
28271\genetic malformity... 
28272\And gaze into the bloody gaping gorge that lies where once her
28273\precious eye had been...
28280*\Gently, you carry her limp body into the tarnished spacecraft... 
28281\Everyone passes the time in silence, no one speaking of the images
28282\which continually churn inside them... 
28283\Until finally, she awakens... 
28284\"He got it, didn't he?" she asks softly, already knowing the
28285\answer before you can nod... 
28286\"Don't worry, I know where he's going... 
28287\And she picks herself up, takes a look about the ship
28288\and then sits down at the controls as if nothing at all could
28289\possibly be the matter... 
28290\Removing the starry sapphire locket from her pouch, she places
28291\it within a small nestle upon the console, and you jump as the
28292\spacecraft roars to life... 
28293\With engines humming and paneled lights flashing, you can only
28294\watch with amazement at this incredible girl, who shows no hint
28295\of the pain which must still bite at her many wounds, save a brief
28296\moment when she touched her hand to her right cheek
28297\and trembled slightly... 
28298\=F137, And then the spaceship bursts into the deep blue of the sky...
28310*\There is much to learn upon your journey through the stars, and
28311\in a way you sense that your adventures are only just beginning...
28312\@Out there, somewhere, looms the shadow of the Savant, in his
28313\hands the power of the Astral Dominae, and deep within you
28314\know that your paths are destined to cross again...
28315\@During the voyage, you spend many a night listening with
28316\fascination to the incredible stories that pass from the
28317\lips of the remarkable girl, Vi Domina, who seems to
28318\possess an unquenchable curiosity about the nature of the
28319\universe and everything else as well, and it is through these
28320\tales that your own new perception of life
28321\and the stars and all that they contain begins to emerge...
28322\@"Hey guys, look what I found!" you hear her cheerfully intone
28323\at odd times of the day, and are pleased to be in the company
28324\of such a pleasant traveling companion and new partner...
28325\@But behind her merry smile, she too, knows...
28326\@That one day will come a reckoning...
28400*\Returning to the Forbidden Zone, the Master Control Station of the
28401\Dark Savant, you are ready to signal your ally, Vitalia

28419\@Finally, you decide to summon your new partner...

28555*\It is the T'Rang, and battling fiercly amongst them a troop of
28556\Umpani soldiers, blades and guns against sizzling power rods and
28557\shattering spells...

28590*\Well done!

28592\Our scanners have detected the Black Ship leaving this sector,
28593\and that could only mean the Dark Savant has obtained the Globe... 
28594\We were so close to victory!! 
28595\There is a ship waiting at the SpacePort in Ukypr... 
28596\We will proceed there immediately for departure... 
28597\And welcome to the S.S.U.F., Secret Service of Umpani Forces! 
28598\Medics, attend to these soldiers at once!

28600\and bleeding girl, and then everything begins to shimmer...
28610*\Upon a great metal vessel bearing the insignia of the Umpani
28611\Federation you peer out into the stars of deep space...

29241\Come back when you change your mind...
29245*\You have betrayed the family! 
29246\I weep for you, and I kiss you...

29336\to purge thy sinful souls of thy unholiness... 
29337\Thy donation of 10% of the gold in thy purse shall cleanse the
29338\evil from thy mind, and the wickedness from thy heart...
29340*\NO/YES/
29341\
29342\Will ye make the holy contribution?
29345*\Thou dost blaspheme the holy name and all Dane!

29347\of the almighty! 
29348\Kill the infidels, my brothers!
29350*\May the divine light guide ye, good brothers! 
29351\And may thy path lead ye to illumination!
29400*\In the blink of an eye, the Master of 5 Flowers is standing before
29401\you...
29403*\Greetings, young masters!
29405*\Your good deed has helped us to preserve the Holy Work, and keep it
29406\safe from the hands of the villanous cretins that have
29407\strayed far from the teachings of the divine Munkharam!
29410*\How may I help you this day?
29415*\You have betrayed the holy teachings and have strayed far from the
29416\righteous path...
29420*\Because of your former good deeds, I shall forgive you this time,
29421\but do not continue to walk the evil path that you tread upon
29422\these days!
29425*\You are as the vermin that infests the eternal cesspool of vile
29426\iniquitiousness... 
29427\You are a warty plague upon our lands! 
29428\Your heart is as diseased a funnel as a maggot's bowel!! 
29429\I shall rid the world of your unholy pestilence!!!
29435*\NO/YES/
29436\
29437\Did you receive my letter?
29440*\I left a note for you at the School of 5 Flowers... &
29441\Look for it there...
29445*\It is plain enough!
29450*\A mixture of the divine Dahlia into a vial of Holy Water will
29451\yield the blessed solution...
29500*\In the distance you hear a horrid moaning... 
29501\It is drawing nearer... 
29502\It's horrible, ghastly... 
29503\It's...
29505*\=954,Brother TShober! 
29506\The wailing (and somewhat inebriated) munk swaggers up...
29510*\Hi-ho (*hic*), fair brothers!
29515*\Methinks (*hic*) the malodorous scum of Dane (may a stampede of
29516\malignant toads defecate in their infectious mouths), (*hic*) are

29531\Er, I mean, (*hic*) I'll go see if I can find 'em! 
29532\I'll show 'em (*hic*) a thing or two!!
29540*\It must be kept safe from the (*hic) blasphemous maggots of Dane,
29541\may a plague of rabid cows vomit upon their lands!
29550*\TShober's Ghost!!! 
29551\NOW YOU'LL PAY! 
29552\HAH HAH HAH!

29590*\NO/YES/
29591\
29592\Do you wish to join her in battle against the spider men?
29600*\In the field ahead you hear the din of a battle in progress...
29602*\A group of brown spidery creatures are flailing with long glowing
29603\rods at something in their midst...
29605*\Suddenly, from between them shoots a bright red sled into the air...
29608*\But it is immediately snared by a net which grabs the end of the
29609\flying vehicle, and the spider men quickly haul it back into the
29610\ground... 
29611\From the crashing sled you see the pilot leap into the foray of
29612\brown attackers... 
29613\It appears to be a woman, heavily outnumbered... 
29614\You see her turn in your direction and call out something, but she
29615\is too far away for you to hear...
29620*\Deciding not to get involved, you watch as the fight continues... 
29621\Soon, the girl is lashed in red from her many bleeding wounds, yet
29622\still she battles onward... 
29623\Being no match for the host of T'Rang which surround her, she
29624\eventually succumbs to their gashing blows... 
29625\You stand safely at a distance and watch as they bind up the
29626\helpless girl, and then drag her and the flying machine off into the
29627\forest...
29630*\You run to help the struggling girl...
29650*\The battle over, the pilot girl returns to her fiery vessel and
29651\glides over to land before you...
29653*\=900,I am Jan-Ette, of the Helazoid Legion...
29655*\Thy courage is great, and thy arms strong! 
29656\I am Jan-Ette, of the Helazoid Legion, Defenders of the City of
29657\Sky... 
29658\I was sent by the great queen of our tribe, Dame Ke-Li, to learn
29659\of the strangers that now inhabit our lands... 
29660\We await the coming of the Crusaders! 
29661\I give to you this banner of my people...
29665*\=900,Carry it with you, that all Helazoid shall know you as friend... 
29666\Present it to Dame Ke-Li, in the City of Sky, and she will welcome
29667\you...
29670*\I recognise you! 
29671\Thou art the cowards who watched idly as I was taken into the claws
29672\of the T'Rang! 
29673\How does it feel to be lower than the worm, spineless whelps... 
29674\I have not forgotten thy lack of courage! 
29675\Fortunately for me, there is one of great valor who does
29676\not tremble with fear at the might of the T'Rang, and twas he that
29677\set me free from my captors! 
29678\I spit upon thy faces, thou pitiful curs!!
29680*\...Saying farewell, the pilot girl, Jan-Ette, throttles her
29681\crimson steed and goes zooming off into the sky...
29700*\O'Haio, kind friends! 
29701\I thought to come by and see how thee doth fare!
29710*\O'Haio, noble ones! 
29711\Welcome to the City of Sky! 
29712\May thy days be filled with joy...
29715*\Begone, strangers! 
29716\Thou are not welcome in the City of Sky!
29750*\Suddenly, from out of the blue, descends a flying red rocket... 
29751\Upon the back of which rides a blazing female warrior...
29755*\O'Haio, strangers! 
29756\Welcome to the lands of Guardia! 
29757\Many are you, who have come from the stars... 
29758\We hail you, for it is the time of the coming of the Crusaders! 
29759\Let destiny prevail! 
29760\...And with that the bizarre lass zooms into the sky and shoots out of
29761\sight...

29880*\The book is filled with chants, prayers and liturgies, and many
29881\references to the Divine Munkharam...
29882\@While it contains nothing that is particularly helpful at
29883\the present, it does have a few nice pictures of flowers...
29885*\Opening the book, you read the following:
29886\@ !THE !CHANT OF !DEMONSPAWN
29887\@Into the pit must ye throw the bowels of our enemies,
29888\!That the blood of their innards may entice the fiend;
29889\@Into the pit must ye sprinkle the Ashes of Diam,
29890\!That the aroma of its scent may incite the fiend;
29891\@Into the pit must ye hurl the Stone of Gates,
29892\!That the magic of the gem may summon the fiend;
29893\@Into the pit must ye recite the Chant of Demonspawn,
29894\!That the power of the word may bind the fiend;
29895\@Then may the Spawn of Hell be vanquished!
29900*\The acrid smell of staleness bites your nostrils as you enter the
29901\rank and dusty chamber, and you surmise that this area was abandoned
29902\quite some time ago...
29903\@Other than the occasional soft pitter patter of little
29904\scampering feet, you hear nothing at all which
29905\breaks the gloomy silence...
29910*\In the corner, you spot a pile of old rotted rags lying in a heap...
29915*\Sifting through the rags, you uncover the remains of whatever it
29916\was that was wearing the clothing now turned to rot...
29917\@Just as you start to turn away from the well decayed corpse, you spy
29918\an old worn parchment still clutched within its boney fingers...
29930*\Approaching the trickling fountain, you are pleasantly surprised to
29931\find that its water still runs fresh and sweet...
29940*\The air inside the secreted passage is dryer than you would have
29941\suspected, an indication that it has remained undiscovered for many
29942\years...
29945*\#!HORROR OF
29946\!RA-SEP RE-TEP
29950*\You pause for a moment to reflect upon the wisdom of disturbing
29951\whatever it is that might lie beyond the gate...
29960*\A sudden flash of fire arises from the sconces along the wall as you
29961\enter the chamber, and dancing in the flicker of their candlelight
29962\you watch as a shadowy form emerges from the depths of a smokey
29963\bubbling pool...
29970*\The skeleton ghoul now splintered into hundreds of tiny bones, you
29971\nonetheless feel uneasy about the mystical chamber, and could almost
29972\swear the little ivory fragments were slowly inching their way back
29973\into the pool...
29975*\Re entering the chamber, you note that most of the bone fragments
29976\have disappeared...
29980*\As you start to leave the crypt, you deliberately step out of your
29981\way to grind a small remaining finger chip into the floor...

31600\Go away, fool.
