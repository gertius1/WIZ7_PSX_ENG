Version history
======================
V1.0 initial release


Project description
======================
This is a ROMhack/patch to translate the Wizardry 7 PSX version from Japanese to English.
The text content form the original English PC version has been adapted, compared and put into the PSX version.
This includes: images/menus, game world descriptions, NPC conversations. 
This makes the PSX version of the game fully playable in English.

The PSX version has some differences to the PC version, which makes it a worthwhile experience.
- Different cinematics
- Different graphics and music
- Creature models are in 3D
- Anime portraits
- Control scheme for console controller
- Fullscreen 3D display
- No typing, all spells, mantras, replies can be selected by a menu
In addition to that, the PSX version can be played in emulators, which for example makes the game available on portable systems like Vita or 2DS/3DS.


List of files
======================
The ROMhack comes with these files:
- README.txt
- Wiz7_patch.xdelta
- Wizardry 7 PSX ENG Manual.pdf
- Wiz7_PSX_Controls.jpg


Installation
======================

- The ROMhack is being delivered as an xdelta patch, to be applied to the .bin of the game with xdelta or xdeltaUI, 
available from romhacking.net.

.bin CRC-32: bab5dd73
MD5: 188d3ee5a2a2242a719f290ea595e5ec



State/Known Bugs
=======================
The game has been tested to be finishable with this English patch 
(following the guide on https://www.crimsontear.com/game-guides/wizardry-7/walkthrough).
Most NPCs have been tested in the final game.
Not every single quest or branch has been tested, but most all of the above walkthrough.
It has been tested with the first ending described in the walkthrough.
Even though it has proven stable in many hours of testing, it cannot be ruled out that there still might be issues.
It is advised to save often. Please report game-breaking or quest-breaking bugs to the thread given below.

Known bugs are:
- very few strings exceed the textbox
- very few strings only show empty textbox (example equipping cursed items), just press any button to advance the game
- some property of weapons (probably damage) appears garbled in the item info subscreen
- most roadsigns/plaque graphics had to be dropped and replaced through a normal textbox because of character restrictions
- some menus only allowed display of first 2 or 3 characters, see manual for explanation

For the most part, it was possible to transfer the text contents largely unchanged from the English version.
However, some strings had to be adapted for size reasons, either for ROMsize, or display size (Japanese strings are usually much shorter than English strings).
